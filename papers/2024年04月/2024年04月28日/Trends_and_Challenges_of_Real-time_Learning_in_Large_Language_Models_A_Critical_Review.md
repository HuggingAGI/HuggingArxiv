> Trends and Challenges of Real-time Learning in Large Language Models: A Critical Review

# 摘要

> 实时学习是指学习系统能够随着时间的推移积累知识，从而实现对新任务的适应和泛化。这一能力对于智能化、实际应用的系统尤为关键，尤其是在数据获取受限或不足的情况下。本篇综述深入探讨了大型语言模型中的实时学习，涵盖了持续学习、元学习、参数高效学习以及专家混合学习等前沿学习范式。通过详细阐述这些领域的具体进展和关键要素，我们展示了这些范式在实时学习中的实际应用价值。文章最后指出了当前面临的挑战，并对未来研究方向提出了展望。通过汇总最新的研究成果，本综述旨在为设计和开发基于LLM的、能够应对现实世界问题的智能学习系统提供全面的理论支持。

> Real-time learning concerns the ability of learning systems to acquire knowledge over time, enabling their adaptation and generalization to novel tasks. It is a critical ability for intelligent, real-world systems, especially when data may be insufficient or difficult to obtain. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of real-time learning in Large Language Models. It synthesizes the state-of-the-art real-time learning paradigms, including continual learning, meta-learning, parameter-efficient learning, and mixture-of-experts learning. We demonstrate their utility for real-time learning by describing specific achievements from these related topics and their critical factors. Finally, the paper highlights current problems and challenges for future research in the field. By consolidating the latest relevant research developments, this review offers a comprehensive understanding of real-time learning and its implications for designing and developing LLM-based learning systems addressing real-world problems.
