> "ChatGPT Is Here to Help, Not to Replace Anybody" -- An Evaluation of Students' Opinions On Integrating ChatGPT In CS Courses

# 摘要

> 像 GPT 和 Bard 这样的大型语言模型能够根据文本描述高效生成代码，这在计算机教育领域可能引发一系列问题，包括对作弊行为、过度依赖以及计算思维能力下降的担忧。尽管已有大量研究探讨教师如何应对这一挑战，但了解学生对于这种技术变革的态度同样关键。本研究调查了52名大一计算机科学学生，旨在了解他们对具有代码生成功能技术的学术和职业看法。调查结果显示，学生们普遍认可 GPT 在学术上的用途，但并不会过度依赖它，而是适度地寻求其辅助。尽管 GPT 对大多数学生有所帮助，但也有学生在使用上存在困难，这凸显了对 GPT 特定培训的需求。关于 GPT 对他们未来职业生涯的影响，学生们的看法各异，但在学术实践中，他们普遍认为 GPT 的重要性不容忽视。

> Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT and Bard are capable of producing code based on textual descriptions, with remarkable efficacy. Such technology will have profound implications for computing education, raising concerns about cheating, excessive dependence, and a decline in computational thinking skills, among others. There has been extensive research on how teachers should handle this challenge but it is also important to understand how students feel about this paradigm shift. In this research, 52 first-year CS students were surveyed in order to assess their views on technologies with code-generation capabilities, both from academic and professional perspectives. Our findings indicate that while students generally favor the academic use of GPT, they don't over rely on it, only mildly asking for its help. Although most students benefit from GPT, some struggle to use it effectively, urging the need for specific GPT training. Opinions on GPT's impact on their professional lives vary, but there is a consensus on its importance in academic practice.
