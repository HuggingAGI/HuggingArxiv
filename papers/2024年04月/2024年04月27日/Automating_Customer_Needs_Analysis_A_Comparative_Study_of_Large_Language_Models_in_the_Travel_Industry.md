> Automating Customer Needs Analysis: A Comparative Study of Large Language Models in the Travel Industry

# 摘要

> 随着自然语言处理技术的飞速发展，大型语言模型（LLMs）已经展现出其在多种任务上的强大能力，比如从海量文本中挖掘关键信息。本研究通过对比分析，旨在探讨不同LLMs在提取TripAdvisor评论中旅行客户需求方面的效能。我们采用了包括开源和商业模型在内的多种模型，如GPT-4和Gemini，以揭示它们在这一特定领域的长短。通过BERTScore、ROUGE和BLEU等评价指标，我们对各模型在精准识别和概括客户需求上的表现进行了评估。研究结果显示，开源的LLMs，尤其是Mirage 7B，在性能上可与更大型的封闭模型相媲美，同时在成本效益和个性化定制方面具有优势。此外，我们还强调了在选择最合适的LLM进行客户需求分析时，需要考虑模型规模、资源需求和性能指标等关键因素。总体上，本研究为那些希望利用高端NLP技术来优化客户体验和提升旅游行业运营效率的企业提供了深刻的洞见。

> In the rapidly evolving landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for many tasks, such as extracting valuable insights from vast amounts of textual data. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of LLMs for the extraction of travel customer needs from TripAdvisor posts. Leveraging a diverse range of models, including both open-source and proprietary ones such as GPT-4 and Gemini, we aim to elucidate their strengths and weaknesses in this specialized domain. Through an evaluation process involving metrics such as BERTScore, ROUGE, and BLEU, we assess the performance of each model in accurately identifying and summarizing customer needs. Our findings highlight the efficacy of opensource LLMs, particularly Mistral 7B, in achieving comparable performance to larger closed models while offering affordability and customization benefits. Additionally, we underscore the importance of considering factors such as model size, resource requirements, and performance metrics when selecting the most suitable LLM for customer needs analysis tasks. Overall, this study contributes valuable insights for businesses seeking to leverage advanced NLP techniques to enhance customer experience and drive operational efficiency in the travel industry.
