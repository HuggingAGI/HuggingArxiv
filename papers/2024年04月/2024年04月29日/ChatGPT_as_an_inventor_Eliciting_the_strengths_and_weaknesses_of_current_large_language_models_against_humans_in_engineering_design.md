> ChatGPT as an inventor: Eliciting the strengths and weaknesses of current large language models against humans in engineering design

# 摘要

> 本项研究将大型语言模型ChatGPT 4.0的设计实践与性能，与参与48小时原型设计竞赛的研究生工程师们进行了对比，研究基于超过100个原型的数据分析。ChatGPT 4.0通过向两名参与者发出指令，由他们执行并反馈，自主构思创意，并独立做出所有设计决策，无需人为干预。该模型展现出与人类参与者相似的原型设计流程，并在六支队伍中荣获亚军，成功地设计并提供了功能性原型的构建指南。ChatGPT 4.0在概念生成方面表现出色，但在遇到小问题时会过早放弃有潜力的创意，设计中加入了不必要的复杂性，并表现出设计上的固执。由于描述不够明确，模型与参与者之间的沟通存在挑战，且在回答中保持连贯性和相关性方面存在困难。基于这些发现，研究提出了六项实施类似ChatGPT的LLM于设计流程的建议，包括利用其进行创意发想，确保人为监督关键决策，建立迭代反馈机制，鼓励其考虑多种选择，以及在子系统层面分配具体且可控的任务。

> This study compares the design practices and performance of ChatGPT 4.0, a large language model (LLM), against graduate engineering students in a 48-hour prototyping hackathon, based on a dataset comprising more than 100 prototypes. The LLM participated by instructing two participants who executed its instructions and provided objective feedback, generated ideas autonomously and made all design decisions without human intervention. The LLM exhibited similar prototyping practices to human participants and finished second among six teams, successfully designing and providing building instructions for functional prototypes. The LLM's concept generation capabilities were particularly strong. However, the LLM prematurely abandoned promising concepts when facing minor difficulties, added unnecessary complexity to designs, and experienced design fixation. Communication between the LLM and participants was challenging due to vague or unclear descriptions, and the LLM had difficulty maintaining continuity and relevance in answers. Based on these findings, six recommendations for implementing an LLM like ChatGPT in the design process are proposed, including leveraging it for ideation, ensuring human oversight for key decisions, implementing iterative feedback loops, prompting it to consider alternatives, and assigning specific and manageable tasks at a subsystem level.
