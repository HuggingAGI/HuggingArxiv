> The GPT Surprise: Offering Large Language Model Chat in a Massive Coding Class Reduced Engagement but Increased Adopters Exam Performances

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）正通过ChatGPT等聊天接口迅速融入学习场景。尽管这些工具触手可及，但它们对学生学习的影响研究尚浅。编程教育尤为关键，因LLMs在编程任务中表现卓越，且其支持工具正成为软件工程师的日常。我们针对5,831名来自146国的在线编程学生进行了随机对照试验，部分学生可使用GPT-4聊天接口。结果显示，使用工具的学生考试成绩提升，但GPT-4的推广却普遍降低了考试参与度。课程参与度也呈下降趋势，但这一现象因学生所在国而异，低人类发展指数国家的学生参与度反而上升。这表明LLMs在编程教育中虽有潜力，但也可能影响学生参与度，其长期效果尚不明朗。我们的研究强调，需深入探索LLMs在教育中的未来应用及其潜在影响。

> Large language models (LLMs) are quickly being adopted in a wide range of learning experiences, especially via ubiquitous and broadly accessible chat interfaces like ChatGPT and Copilot. This type of interface is readily available to students and teachers around the world, yet relatively little research has been done to assess the impact of such generic tools on student learning. Coding education is an interesting test case, both because LLMs have strong performance on coding tasks, and because LLM-powered support tools are rapidly becoming part of the workflow of professional software engineers. To help understand the impact of generic LLM use on coding education, we conducted a large-scale randomized control trial with 5,831 students from 146 countries in an online coding class in which we provided some students with access to a chat interface with GPT-4. We estimate positive benefits on exam performance for adopters, the students who used the tool, but over all students, the advertisement of GPT-4 led to a significant average decrease in exam participation. We observe similar decreases in other forms of course engagement. However, this decrease is modulated by the student's country of origin. Offering access to LLMs to students from low human development index countries increased their exam participation rate on average. Our results suggest there may be promising benefits to using LLMs in an introductory coding class, but also potential harms for engagement, which makes their longer term impact on student success unclear. Our work highlights the need for additional investigations to help understand the potential impact of future adoption and integration of LLMs into classrooms.
