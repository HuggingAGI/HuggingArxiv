# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）的普及及其融入多智能体系统，为各行业的高级自动化开辟了新径。本文提出了AutoGenesisAgent，一个能够独立设计并定制部署特定任务多智能体系统的系统。它由多个专业智能体组成，包括系统理解、系统设计、智能体生成等，协同管理从概念构想到系统部署的全过程。每个智能体承担着从解析输入到优化性能的不同职责，最终实现系统的即时使用。本概念验证研究探讨了AutoGenesisAgent的设计和实现，以及开发过程中的心得体会，强调了其在自主生成和优化多智能体系统方面的能力，减少了系统设计初期对人工监督的依赖。关键词包括：多智能体系统、大型语言模型、系统设计自动化、智能体架构、自主系统、软件部署。

> The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) and their integration into multi-agent systems has paved the way for sophisticated automation in various domains. This paper introduces AutoGenesisAgent, a multi-agent system that autonomously designs and deploys other multi-agent systems tailored for specific tasks. AutoGenesisAgent comprises several specialized agents including System Understanding, System Design, Agent Generator, and several others that collectively manage the lifecycle of creating functional multi-agent systems from initial concept to deployment. Each agent in AutoGenesisAgent has distinct responsibilities ranging from interpreting input prompts to optimizing system performance, culminating, in the deployment of a ready-to-use system. This proof-of-concept study discusses the design, implementation, and lessons learned from developing AutoGenesisAgent, highlighting its capability to generate and refine multi-agent systems autonomously, thereby reducing the need for extensive human oversight in the initial stages of system design. Keywords: multi-agent systems, large language models, system design automation, agent architecture, autonomous systems, software deployment
