> 生成式AI（GenAI），尤其是大型语言模型，正深刻影响着计算机科学教育。它们在众多挑战中展现出日益增强的能力，引发了一些教育者的担忧，认为它们可能威胁到计算机教育，甚至主张在课堂上禁用。然而，在探讨这些未解问题的同时，审视计算机科学的整体发展趋势或许更为重要。自学科诞生之初，我们便不断追求在每种新表示中提升抽象层次，从硬件拨码开关到专用语言，再到流程图，直至现今的“自然语言”。GenAI的到来，使学生能够将问题抽象至他们熟悉的“语言”层面，这正是我们编程抽象的终极目标——自然语言。因此，本文主张，现在是时候在计算机科学教育中推行“提示优先”策略了。

> Generative AI (GenAI) and large language models in particular, are disrupting Computer Science Education. They are proving increasingly capable at more and more challenges. Some educators argue that they pose a serious threat to computing education, and that we should ban their use in the classroom. While there are serious GenAI issues that remain unsolved, it may be useful in the present moment to step back and examine the overall trajectory of Computer Science writ large. Since the very beginning, our discipline has sought to increase the level of abstraction in each new representation. We have progressed from hardware dip switches, through special purpose languages and visual representations like flow charts, all the way now to ``natural language.'' With the advent of GenAI, students can finally change the abstraction level of a problem to the ``language'' they've been ``problem solving'' with all their lives. In this paper, we argue that our programming abstractions were always headed here -- to natural language. Now is the time to adopt a ``Prompts First'' approach to Computer Science Education.
