> Structuring Authenticity Assessments on Historical Documents using LLMs

# 摘要

> 历史上的伪造行为广泛存在，学者们持续评估历史文件的真实性。但在线目录仅提供描述性元数据，使得真实性讨论难以系统研究。本研究通过自然语言文本生成结构化数据，利用大型语言模型（LLM）自动选择、提取和分类相关声明，结合语义网技术进行结构化和验证。最终产出包含争议文件及其学者意见的目录，为深入分析历史辩论提供可能。

> Given the wide use of forgery throughout history, scholars have and are continuously engaged in assessing the authenticity of historical documents. However, online catalogues merely offer descriptive metadata for these documents, relegating discussions about their authenticity to free-text formats, making it difficult to study these assessments at scale. This study explores the generation of structured data about documents' authenticity assessment from natural language texts. Our pipeline exploits Large Language Models (LLMs) to select, extract and classify relevant claims about the topic without the need for training, and Semantic Web technologies to structure and type-validate the LLM's results. The final output is a catalogue of documents whose authenticity has been debated, along with scholars' opinions on their authenticity. This process can serve as a valuable resource for integration into catalogues, allowing room for more intricate queries and analyses on the evolution of these debates over centuries.
