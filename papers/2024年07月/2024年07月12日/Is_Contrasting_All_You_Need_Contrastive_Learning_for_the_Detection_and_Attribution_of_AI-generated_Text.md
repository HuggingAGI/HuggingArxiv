> Is Contrasting All You Need? Contrastive Learning for the Detection and Attribution of AI-generated Text

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型的进步使得人机文本界限愈发模糊。AI文本的泛滥及其难以识别性，给社会带来新挑战。本文中，我们提出WhosAI框架，通过三元组网络对比学习，不仅能判断文本来源（人或AI），还能揭示作者身份。与传统方法不同，WhosAI从多生成器中同步学习语义表示，兼顾检测与归属。此外，WhosAI不依赖特定模型，能随新AI模型发布而扩展。实验表明，在TuringBench的20万新闻文章测试中，WhosAI在图灵测试与作者归属任务上表现卓越，超越了所有现有方法。

> The significant progress in the development of Large Language Models has contributed to blurring the distinction between human and AI-generated text. The increasing pervasiveness of AI-generated text and the difficulty in detecting it poses new challenges for our society. In this paper, we tackle the problem of detecting and attributing AI-generated text by proposing WhosAI, a triplet-network contrastive learning framework designed to predict whether a given input text has been generated by humans or AI and to unveil the authorship of the text. Unlike most existing approaches, our proposed framework is conceived to learn semantic similarity representations from multiple generators at once, thus equally handling both detection and attribution tasks. Furthermore, WhosAI is model-agnostic and scalable to the release of new AI text-generation models by incorporating their generated instances into the embedding space learned by our framework. Experimental results on the TuringBench benchmark of 200K news articles show that our proposed framework achieves outstanding results in both the Turing Test and Authorship Attribution tasks, outperforming all the methods listed in the TuringBench benchmark leaderboards.
