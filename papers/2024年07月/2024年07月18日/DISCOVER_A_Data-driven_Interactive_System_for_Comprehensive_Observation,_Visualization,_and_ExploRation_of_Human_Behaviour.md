# 摘要

> 理解人类行为是社会科学的核心目标，但这一领域的分析充满挑战。传统方法因数据收集和分析的复杂性，常受限于时间和资源。为此，计算模型崭露头角，能自动识别关键行为指标，如社交信号，助力大数据分析。然而，这些尖端模型的普及受阻于其复杂性和高昂的计算资源需求，限制了非技术背景研究者的参与。为此，我们推出了DISCOVER——一个模块化、灵活且易用的软件框架，旨在简化人类行为分析的计算探索。我们的目标是将高级计算方法普及化，让各领域研究者无需深厚技术背景即可深入行为分析。本文通过四个递进的工作流程——交互式语义探索、视觉检查、辅助注释和多模态场景搜索——展示了DISCOVER的强大功能。我们强调其多功能性和易用性，并提供了一套探索性数据分析的蓝图，作为研究的起点。

> Understanding human behavior is a fundamental goal of social sciences, yet its analysis presents significant challenges. Conventional methodologies employed for the study of behavior, characterized by labor-intensive data collection processes and intricate analyses, frequently hinder comprehensive exploration due to their time and resource demands. In response to these challenges, computational models have proven to be promising tools that help researchers analyze large amounts of data by automatically identifying important behavioral indicators, such as social signals. However, the widespread adoption of such state-of-the-art computational models is impeded by their inherent complexity and the substantial computational resources necessary to run them, thereby constraining accessibility for researchers without technical expertise and adequate equipment. To address these barriers, we introduce DISCOVER -- a modular and flexible, yet user-friendly software framework specifically developed to streamline computational-driven data exploration for human behavior analysis. Our primary objective is to democratize access to advanced computational methodologies, thereby enabling researchers across disciplines to engage in detailed behavioral analysis without the need for extensive technical proficiency. In this paper, we demonstrate the capabilities of DISCOVER using four exemplary data exploration workflows that build on each other: Interactive Semantic Content Exploration, Visual Inspection, Aided Annotation, and Multimodal Scene Search. By illustrating these workflows, we aim to emphasize the versatility and accessibility of DISCOVER as a comprehensive framework and propose a set of blueprints that can serve as a general starting point for exploratory data analysis.
