> 本研究通过改进现有RAG模型，利用图技术构建了一个先进的RAG系统，旨在提升知识型问答系统的质量。现有RAG模型虽准确流畅，但依赖预加载知识且无法整合实时数据，导致准确性和上下文理解受限。新系统通过LangGraph评估信息可靠性，综合多源数据生成更精准的回答。研究还详细阐述了系统运作、关键步骤及实例，加深了对RAG技术的理解，为企业实施先进RAG系统提供了实用指南。

> This study aims to improve knowledge-based question-answering (QA) systems by overcoming the limitations of existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models and implementing an advanced RAG system based on Graph technology to develop high-quality generative AI services. While existing RAG models demonstrate high accuracy and fluency by utilizing retrieved information, they may suffer from accuracy degradation as they generate responses using pre-loaded knowledge without reprocessing. Additionally, they cannot incorporate real-time data after the RAG configuration stage, leading to issues with contextual understanding and biased information. To address these limitations, this study implemented an enhanced RAG system utilizing Graph technology. This system is designed to efficiently search and utilize information. Specifically, it employs LangGraph to evaluate the reliability of retrieved information and synthesizes diverse data to generate more accurate and enhanced responses. Furthermore, the study provides a detailed explanation of the system's operation, key implementation steps, and examples through implementation code and validation results, thereby enhancing the understanding of advanced RAG technology. This approach offers practical guidelines for implementing advanced RAG systems in corporate services, making it a valuable resource for practical application.
