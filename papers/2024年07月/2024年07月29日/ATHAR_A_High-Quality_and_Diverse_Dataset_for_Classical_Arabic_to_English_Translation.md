> ATHAR: A High-Quality and Diverse Dataset for Classical Arabic to English Translation

# 摘要

> 古典阿拉伯语见证了文化、哲学和科学的辉煌，其文献的翻译对于知识共享至关重要。随着大型语言模型（LLM）和翻译技术的进步，我们有了新的工具来推动这一目标。然而，古典阿拉伯语的翻译数据集却稀缺且局限，影响了高质量翻译系统的发展。为此，我们创建了ATHAR数据集，收录了66,000个高质量的古典阿拉伯语至英语翻译样本，广泛覆盖科学、文化和哲学等领域。我们还测试了最先进的LLM，发现它们在处理这些数据时仍有提升空间。我们的研究表明，通过微调或整合ATHAR数据集，模型性能可得到显著提升。该数据集已在HuggingFace平台公开，供大家使用。

> Classical Arabic represents a significant era, encompassing the golden age of Arab culture, philosophy, and scientific literature. With a broad consensus on the importance of translating these literatures to enrich knowledge dissemination across communities, the advent of large language models (LLMs) and translation systems offers promising tools to facilitate this goal. However, we have identified a scarcity of translation datasets in Classical Arabic, which are often limited in scope and topics, hindering the development of high-quality translation systems. In response, we present the ATHAR dataset, comprising 66,000 high-quality Classical Arabic to English translation samples that cover a wide array of subjects including science, culture, and philosophy. Furthermore, we assess the performance of current state-of-the-art LLMs under various settings, concluding that there is a need for such datasets in current systems. Our findings highlight how models can benefit from fine-tuning or incorporating this dataset into their pretraining pipelines. The dataset is publicly available on the HuggingFace Data Hub at \url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/mohamed-khalil/ATHAR}.
