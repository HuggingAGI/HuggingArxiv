# 摘要

> 我们推出了专为 Apple Intelligence 功能定制的语言模型，其中包括一款约 30 亿参数的设备高效模型和一款专为私有云设计的大型服务器模型。这些模型旨在以高效、准确且负责任的方式处理多样任务。报告详细介绍了模型架构、训练数据、训练流程、推理优化及评估成果，并强调了我们在模型开发中对负责任 AI 原则的贯彻实施。

> We present foundation language models developed to power Apple Intelligence features, including a ~3 billion parameter model designed to run efficiently on devices and a large server-based language model designed for Private Cloud Compute. These models are designed to perform a wide range of tasks efficiently, accurately, and responsibly. This report describes the model architecture, the data used to train the model, the training process, how the models are optimized for inference, and the evaluation results. We highlight our focus on Responsible AI and how the principles are applied throughout the model development.
