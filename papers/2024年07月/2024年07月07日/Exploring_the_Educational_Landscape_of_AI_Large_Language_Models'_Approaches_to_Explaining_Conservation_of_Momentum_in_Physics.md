# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）在教育领域的应用，尤其是在物理学这样需要精确概念理解的领域，既充满机遇也面临挑战。本研究聚焦于六种顶尖LLMs解释动量守恒定律的能力，这是物理学的核心原理。我们通过分析模型对日语简单提示的响应，评估了它们的解释深度、适应性及教育层面的适用性。综合分析显示，模型在解释风格上存在显著差异：ChatGPT4.0和Coral提供详尽技术解释，Gemini模型则更侧重直观说明。研究发现，模型在处理关键物理概念和强调数学严谨性与实际应用方面各有侧重。这表明，不同模型适用于不同教育阶段，从基础到高级。ChatGPT4.0和Coral适合深入讨论，Gemini模型则更适于基础教学。研究强调，教育者在利用这些AI工具时的重要性，因为模型在传达物理原理的细微差别方面能力各异。此研究为LLMs在物理教育中的应用提供了基础，并为教育者整合这些工具提供了指导。同时，它也指出了在STEM领域进一步探索AI辅助学习的必要性，为AI在物理教育中的更高级应用奠定了基础。

> The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in education offers both opportunities and challenges, particularly in fields like physics that demand precise conceptual understanding. This study examines the capabilities of six state-of-the-art LLMs in explaining the law of conservation of momentum, a fundamental principle in physics. By analyzing responses to a consistent, simple prompt in Japanese, we assess the models' explanatory approaches, depth of understanding, and adaptability to different educational levels.Our comprehensive analysis, encompassing text characteristics, response similarity, and keyword usage, unveils significant diversity in explanatory styles across models. ChatGPT4.0 and Coral provided more comprehensive and technically detailed explanations, while Gemini models tended toward more intuitive approaches. Key findings include variations in the treatment of critical concepts such as net force, and differing emphases on mathematical rigor and real-world applications.The results indicate that different AI models may be more suitable for various educational contexts, ranging from introductory to advanced levels. ChatGPT4.0 and Coral demonstrated potential for advanced discussions, while Gemini models appeared more appropriate for introductory explanations. Importantly, the study underscores the necessity of educator guidance in effectively leveraging these AI tools, as models varied in their ability to convey nuanced aspects of physical principles.This research establishes a foundation for understanding the educational potential of LLMs in physics, providing insights for educators on integrating these tools into their teaching practices. It also highlights the need for further investigation into AI-assisted learning in STEM fields, paving the way for more sophisticated applications of AI in physics education.
