> WorkArena++: Towards Compositional Planning and Reasoning-based Common Knowledge Work Tasks

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型 (LLM) 模仿人类智能的能力催生了基于 LLM 的自主代理的兴起。尽管这些模型在用户指令下展现出规划和推理的能力，但它们在实际任务解决中的应用效果仍有待深入探索，尤其是在企业环境中。为此，我们推出了 WorkArena++，这是一个包含 682 个真实工作流程任务的基准测试，旨在全面评估网络代理的各项能力。我们的研究发现，这些模型在成为高效工作助手方面仍面临挑战。此外，我们还开发了一种机制，可轻松生成大量真实数据，用于模型的微调。我们期待这项工作能为社区在自主代理领域的发展提供有力支持。基准测试详情请访问：https://github.com/ServiceNow/WorkArena/tree/workarena-plus-plus。

> The ability of large language models (LLMs) to mimic human-like intelligence has led to a surge in LLM-based autonomous agents. Though recent LLMs seem capable of planning and reasoning given user instructions, their effectiveness in applying these capabilities for autonomous task solving remains underexplored. This is especially true in enterprise settings, where automated agents hold the promise of a high impact. To fill this gap, we propose WorkArena++, a novel benchmark consisting of 682 tasks corresponding to realistic workflows routinely performed by knowledge workers. WorkArena++ is designed to evaluate the planning, problem-solving, logical/arithmetic reasoning, retrieval, and contextual understanding abilities of web agents. Our empirical studies across state-of-the-art LLMs and vision-language models (VLMs), as well as human workers, reveal several challenges for such models to serve as useful assistants in the workplace. In addition to the benchmark, we provide a mechanism to effortlessly generate thousands of ground-truth observation/action traces, which can be used for fine-tuning existing models. Overall, we expect this work to serve as a useful resource to help the community progress toward capable autonomous agents.
