> Undermining Mental Proof: How AI Can Make Cooperation Harder by Making Thinking Easier

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型等高级AI系统虽简化了决策过程，却可能降低社交互动的效果。我们提出“心理证明”这一理论，解释了为何可见行为能验证不可见的心理状态。在信任度低的环境中，如招聘或约会，心理证明帮助人们传递私密信息。结合多学科研究，我们揭示了心理证明的运作机制，并分析了AI如何在简化思维的同时，增加了低信任合作的难度。

> Large language models and other highly capable AI systems ease the burdens of deciding what to say or do, but this very ease can undermine the effectiveness of our actions in social contexts. We explain this apparent tension by introducing the integrative theoretical concept of "mental proof," which occurs when observable actions are used to certify unobservable mental facts. From hiring to dating, mental proofs enable people to credibly communicate values, intentions, states of knowledge, and other private features of their minds to one another in low-trust environments where honesty cannot be easily enforced. Drawing on results from economics, theoretical biology, and computer science, we describe the core theoretical mechanisms that enable people to effect mental proofs. An analysis of these mechanisms clarifies when and how artificial intelligence can make low-trust cooperation harder despite making thinking easier.
