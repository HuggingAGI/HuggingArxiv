> 在建筑工地等非结构化环境中使用机器人自动化任务一直是技术追求的目标。然而，这些环境中频繁的不可预测事件限制了其应用，相比之下，制造业等结构化环境中的机器人则更为普及。近期，大型语言模型（LLMs）等预训练基础模型通过提供训练数据之外问题的零-shot解决方案，展示了强大的泛化能力，为机器人进入非结构化环境提供了新思路。本研究从多角度审视了这些模型的应用潜力与挑战，并系统分析了它们在机器人技术和非结构化环境中的实际应用，结合深思熟虑的行动理论进行了综合。研究发现，LLMs的语言能力在提升人机交互感知方面尤为突出，同时在建筑项目管理、安全监控及灾害响应中的应用也日益广泛。基于这些发现，我们将当前技术水平定位为条件自动化，并据此展望了未来发展方向、潜在挑战及解决方案，旨在构建更安全、自主的非结构化环境。本研究成果可作为评估和追踪该领域进展的重要基准。

> Automating activities through robots in unstructured environments, such as construction sites, has been a long-standing desire. However, the high degree of unpredictable events in these settings has resulted in far less adoption compared to more structured settings, such as manufacturing, where robots can be hard-coded or trained on narrowly defined datasets. Recently, pretrained foundation models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated superior generalization capabilities by providing zero-shot solutions for problems do not present in the training data, proposing them as a potential solution for introducing robots to unstructured environments. To this end, this study investigates potential opportunities and challenges of pretrained foundation models from a multi-dimensional perspective. The study systematically reviews application of foundation models in two field of robotic and unstructured environment and then synthesized them with deliberative acting theory. Findings showed that linguistic capabilities of LLMs have been utilized more than other features for improving perception in human-robot interactions. On the other hand, findings showed that the use of LLMs demonstrated more applications in project management and safety in construction, and natural hazard detection in disaster management. Synthesizing these findings, we located the current state-of-the-art in this field on a five-level scale of automation, placing them at conditional automation. This assessment was then used to envision future scenarios, challenges, and solutions toward autonomous safe unstructured environments. Our study can be seen as a benchmark to track our progress toward that future.
