# 摘要

> 近年来，代理在自然语言沟通和合作竞争环境中表现出色，但也带来了社会困境。理解这些环境中的决策复杂且具挑战性，人类需借助解释来理解。然而，可解释AI领域对此类环境的探索甚少。现有解释方法虽适用于合作环境，却未能解决代理间竞争和隐性沟通等问题。为此，我们设计了新的解释方法，并通过混合动机游戏验证其对人类的效果和实用性。最终，我们证明了这些方法的普遍性和在其他游戏中的应用潜力，甚至包括使用大型语言模型模仿人类游戏行动的场景。

> In recent years, agents have become capable of communicating seamlessly via natural language and navigating in environments that involve cooperation and competition, a fact that can introduce social dilemmas. Due to the interleaving of cooperation and competition, understanding agents' decision-making in such environments is challenging, and humans can benefit from obtaining explanations. However, such environments and scenarios have rarely been explored in the context of explainable AI. While some explanation methods for cooperative environments can be applied in mixed-motive setups, they do not address inter-agent competition, cheap-talk, or implicit communication by actions. In this work, we design explanation methods to address these issues. Then, we proceed to demonstrate their effectiveness and usefulness for humans, using a non-trivial mixed-motive game as a test case. Lastly, we establish generality and demonstrate the applicability of the methods to other games, including one where we mimic human game actions using large language models.
