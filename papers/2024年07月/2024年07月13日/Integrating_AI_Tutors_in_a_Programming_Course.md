> RAGMan 是一款由 LLM 驱动的智能辅导系统，专为课程和作业定制的 AI 导师提供支持。它通过结合检索增强生成（RAG）技术和严格指令，确保 AI 导师的回答精准且符合教学要求。学生在使用 RAGMan 的 AI 导师时，既能获得作业帮助，又不会直接得到答案，还能咨询编程相关问题。在一门有 455 名学生的编程入门课程中，RAGMan 作为可选资源被引入，并配置了五位作业专用的 AI 导师。本文详细介绍了学生与 AI 导师的互动情况、学生反馈及成绩对比分析。大约一半的学生与 AI 导师互动，且大部分互动都是关于作业的合理提问。在学生提问符合预期范围时，AI 导师的回答准确率高达 98%。使用 AI 导师的学生中，78% 认为这些导师对他们的学习有帮助。此外，学生们还赞赏 AI 导师营造了一个无压力、无评判的学习环境。

> RAGMan is an LLM-powered tutoring system that can support a variety of course-specific and homework-specific AI tutors. RAGMan leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), as well as strict instructions, to ensure the alignment of the AI tutors' responses. By using RAGMan's AI tutors, students receive assistance with their specific homework assignments without directly obtaining solutions, while also having the ability to ask general programming-related questions.
  RAGMan was deployed as an optional resource in an introductory programming course with an enrollment of 455 students. It was configured as a set of five homework-specific AI tutors. This paper describes the interactions the students had with the AI tutors, the students' feedback, and a comparative grade analysis. Overall, about half of the students engaged with the AI tutors, and the vast majority of the interactions were legitimate homework questions. When students posed questions within the intended scope, the AI tutors delivered accurate responses 98% of the time. Within the students used AI tutors, 78% reported that the tutors helped their learning. Beyond AI tutors' ability to provide valuable suggestions, students reported appreciating them for fostering a safe learning environment free from judgment.
