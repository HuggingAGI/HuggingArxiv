> Human-artificial intelligence teaming for scientific information extraction from data-driven additive manufacturing research using large language models

# 摘要

> 近年来，增材制造（AM）领域的数据驱动研究取得了巨大成功，催生了大量科学文献。这些文献蕴含着AM与人工智能（AI）的丰富知识，但尚未被系统整合。从中提取科学信息既费时又费力。尽管AM专家已撰写了二十余篇综述论文，但针对AM与AI特定内容的信息提取仍依赖人工。得益于BERT和GPT等基础模型在文本处理上的突破，科学信息提取的加速成为可能。我们设计了一个框架，促进AM与AI专家的协作，实现从AM文献中持续提取科学信息。基于此框架，我们开发了演示工具，并通过案例研究，展示了从数据集、建模、传感及AM系统等类别中提取信息的能力。未来，该框架有望拓展至工程领域更广泛的设计与制造文献中，助力信息提取。

> Data-driven research in Additive Manufacturing (AM) has gained significant success in recent years. This has led to a plethora of scientific literature to emerge. The knowledge in these works consists of AM and Artificial Intelligence (AI) contexts that have not been mined and formalized in an integrated way. It requires substantial effort and time to extract scientific information from these works. AM domain experts have contributed over two dozen review papers to summarize these works. However, information specific to AM and AI contexts still requires manual effort to extract. The recent success of foundation models such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations for Transformers) or GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) on textual data has opened the possibility of expediting scientific information extraction. We propose a framework that enables collaboration between AM and AI experts to continuously extract scientific information from data-driven AM literature. A demonstration tool is implemented based on the proposed framework and a case study is conducted to extract information relevant to the datasets, modeling, sensing, and AM system categories. We show the ability of LLMs (Large Language Models) to expedite the extraction of relevant information from data-driven AM literature. In the future, the framework can be used to extract information from the broader design and manufacturing literature in the engineering discipline.
