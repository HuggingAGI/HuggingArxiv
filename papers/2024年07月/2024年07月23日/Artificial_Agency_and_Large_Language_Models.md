# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLM）的问世，激起了关于人工实现代理可能性的哲学探讨。本研究提出一个理论模型，作为人工代理的门槛概念，定义代理为受其历史、适应能力和环境动态影响的系统。我们通过此模型指出，尽管当前的LLM尚未达到代理标准，但已显露出发展潜力。结合Park等（2023）的架构与Boiko等（2023）的Coscientist模块，或许是实现人工代理的路径。文章末尾，我们探讨了构建此类代理的挑战，并展望了未来研究方向。

> The arrival of Large Language Models (LLMs) has stirred up philosophical debates about the possibility of realizing agency in an artificial manner. In this work we contribute to the debate by presenting a theoretical model that can be used as a threshold conception for artificial agents. The model defines agents as systems whose actions and goals are always influenced by a dynamic framework of factors that consists of the agent's accessible history, its adaptive repertoire and its external environment. This framework, in turn, is influenced by the actions that the agent takes and the goals that it forms. We show with the help of the model that state-of-the-art LLMs are not agents yet, but that there are elements to them that suggest a way forward. The paper argues that a combination of the agent architecture presented in Park et al. (2023) together with the use of modules like the Coscientist in Boiko et al. (2023) could potentially be a way to realize agency in an artificial manner. We end the paper by reflecting on the obstacles one might face in building such an artificial agent and by presenting possible directions for future research.
