> OpenDevin: An Open Platform for AI Software Developers as Generalist Agents

# 摘要

> 软件作为人类最强大的工具之一，赋予程序员以复杂而深刻的方式与世界互动的能力。随着大型语言模型（LLM）的进步，AI代理在与环境互动和产生影响方面也迅速发展。本文介绍的OpenDevin平台，旨在开发与人类开发者相似方式互动的强大且灵活的AI代理，包括编写代码、命令行交互和网页浏览。该平台支持新代理的实现、安全代码执行、多代理协调及评估基准的整合。我们基于现有基准对15个挑战性任务进行了代理评估，涵盖软件工程和网页浏览等领域。OpenDevin作为学术与工业界合作的社区项目，已获得160多名贡献者的1.3K贡献，并将持续进步。

> Software is one of the most powerful tools that we humans have at our disposal; it allows a skilled programmer to interact with the world in complex and profound ways. At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that interact with and affect change in their surrounding environments. In this paper, we introduce OpenDevin, a platform for the development of powerful and flexible AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a human developer: by writing code, interacting with a command line, and browsing the web. We describe how the platform allows for the implementation of new agents, safe interaction with sandboxed environments for code execution, coordination between multiple agents, and incorporation of evaluation benchmarks. Based on our currently incorporated benchmarks, we perform an evaluation of agents over 15 challenging tasks, including software engineering (e.g., SWE-Bench) and web browsing (e.g., WebArena), among others. Released under the permissive MIT license, OpenDevin is a community project spanning academia and industry with more than 1.3K contributions from over 160 contributors and will improve going forward.
