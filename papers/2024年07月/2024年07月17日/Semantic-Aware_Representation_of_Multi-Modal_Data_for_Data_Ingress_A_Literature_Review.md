> Semantic-Aware Representation of Multi-Modal Data for Data Ingress: A Literature Review

# 摘要

> 机器学习正不断深入众多应用领域，生成式AI如大型语言模型也广泛用于处理多模态数据。尽管训练数据集日益庞大，但高效管理这些数据已成为行业挑战——数据量倍增并不等于质量倍增。理解数据湖的内在质量和多样性对特定应用ML和基础模型微调至关重要。此外，时间序列数据的时间维度增加了从数据湖中检索信息的复杂性。本研究探索从单模态到跨模态数据中提取嵌入的语义感知技术，以提升数据湖的检索能力。文章总结了嵌入技术在三种数据模态应用中的最新进展。

> Machine Learning (ML) is continuously permeating a growing amount of application domains. Generative AI such as Large Language Models (LLMs) also sees broad adoption to process multi-modal data such as text, images, audio, and video. While the trend is to use ever-larger datasets for training, managing this data efficiently has become a significant practical challenge in the industry-double as much data is certainly not double as good. Rather the opposite is important since getting an understanding of the inherent quality and diversity of the underlying data lakes is a growing challenge for application-specific ML as well as for fine-tuning foundation models. Furthermore, information retrieval (IR) from expanding data lakes is complicated by the temporal dimension inherent in time-series data which must be considered to determine its semantic value. This study focuses on the different semantic-aware techniques to extract embeddings from mono-modal, multi-modal, and cross-modal data to enhance IR capabilities in a growing data lake. Articles were collected to summarize information about the state-of-the-art techniques focusing on applications of embedding for three different categories of data modalities.
