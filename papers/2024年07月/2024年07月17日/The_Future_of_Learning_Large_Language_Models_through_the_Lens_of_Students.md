> The Future of Learning: Large Language Models through the Lens of Students

# 摘要

> 随着LLMs的持续进步，它们在性能和功能上的显著提升正影响着教育等多个领域。我们通过对14名学生的访谈，揭示了他们在与ChatGPT互动时面临的困境：一方面享受其高效的学习辅助，另一方面则担忧其结果的可靠性和伦理问题。学生们感受到ChatGPT比传统AI更“人性化”，这种复杂的情感体验暗示了其在教育中的潜在价值。尽管如此，我们强调，这种高级智能的人性化特质虽吸引人，但其强大能力也可能带来负面影响。因此，在应用时需谨慎，并致力于在未来发展中降低潜在风险。

> As Large-Scale Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, they demonstrate significant enhancements in performance and an expansion of functionalities, impacting various domains, including education. In this study, we conducted interviews with 14 students to explore their everyday interactions with ChatGPT. Our preliminary findings reveal that students grapple with the dilemma of utilizing ChatGPT's efficiency for learning and information seeking, while simultaneously experiencing a crisis of trust and ethical concerns regarding the outcomes and broader impacts of ChatGPT. The students perceive ChatGPT as being more "human-like" compared to traditional AI. This dilemma, characterized by mixed emotions, inconsistent behaviors, and an overall positive attitude towards ChatGPT, underscores its potential for beneficial applications in education and learning. However, we argue that despite its human-like qualities, the advanced capabilities of such intelligence might lead to adverse consequences. Therefore, it's imperative to approach its application cautiously and strive to mitigate potential harms in future developments.
