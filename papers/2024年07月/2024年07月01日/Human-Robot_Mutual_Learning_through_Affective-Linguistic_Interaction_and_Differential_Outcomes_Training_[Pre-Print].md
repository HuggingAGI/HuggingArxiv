# 摘要

> 随着大型语言模型的兴起，现代AI更多地聚焦于与人类的语言交流，而对人机间的非语言沟通关注不足。本文探讨了情感语言交流结合差异结果训练对人机互动中相互学习的影响。借鉴儿童与看护者的互动模式，我们设计了一个模拟场景：机器人学习如何有效表达其内部需求，而人类“看护者”则学习如何准确响应这些需求。通过对比不同训练和学习策略，我们评估了相互学习的准确性和效率。实验表明，采用差异结果训练（DOT）的机器人学习效果显著优于对照组，且探索-利用策略的选择进一步提升了学习成效。这些成果为社会辅助机器人在治疗和教育领域的应用提供了新视角。

> Owing to the recent success of Large Language Models, Modern A.I has been much focused on linguistic interactions with humans but less focused on non-linguistic forms of communication between man and machine. In the present paper, we test how affective-linguistic communication, in combination with differential outcomes training, affects mutual learning in a human-robot context. Taking inspiration from child-caregiver dynamics, our human-robot interaction setup consists of a (simulated) robot attempting to learn how best to communicate internal, homeostatically-controlled needs; while a human "caregiver" attempts to learn the correct object to satisfy the robot's present communicated need. We studied the effects of i) human training type, and ii) robot reinforcement learning type, to assess mutual learning terminal accuracy and rate of learning (as measured by the average reward achieved by the robot). Our results find mutual learning between a human and a robot is significantly improved with Differential Outcomes Training (DOT) compared to Non-DOT (control) conditions. We find further improvements when the robot uses an exploration-exploitation policy selection, compared to purely exploitation policy selection. These findings have implications for utilizing socially assistive robots (SAR) in therapeutic contexts, e.g. for cognitive interventions, and educational applications.
