> Empathic Grounding: Explorations using Multimodal Interaction and Large Language Models with Conversational Agents

# 摘要

> 我们提出了“共情基础”概念，扩展了Clark的对话基础理论，强调听众需理解说话者的情感状态。当说话者情绪突出时，共情基础尤为重要，它通过传递命题和情感理解，使沟通更高效可靠。情感表达和共情反应均可多模态化，涉及面部表情等非言语信号。因此，具身代理的共情模型应多模态化，以促进自然沟通。我们构建了一个多模态模型，结合用户的话语和面部表情，利用大型语言模型生成多模态的共情反应。此外，我们设计了一个测试平台，通过人形机器人访谈用户过去的痛苦经历，并由用户评价机器人的共情表现。实验对比显示，共情基础显著提升了用户对共情、理解、情绪智力和信任的感知。我们的研究凸显了情绪意识和多模态在对话代理中生成有效反应的重要性。

> We introduce the concept of "empathic grounding" in conversational agents as an extension of Clark's conceptualization of grounding in conversation in which the grounding criterion includes listener empathy for the speaker's affective state. Empathic grounding is generally required whenever the speaker's emotions are foregrounded and can make the grounding process more efficient and reliable by communicating both propositional and affective understanding. Both speaker expressions of affect and listener empathic grounding can be multimodal, including facial expressions and other nonverbal displays. Thus, models of empathic grounding for embodied agents should be multimodal to facilitate natural and efficient communication. We describe a multimodal model that takes as input user speech and facial expression to generate multimodal grounding moves for a listening agent using a large language model. We also describe a testbed to evaluate approaches to empathic grounding, in which a humanoid robot interviews a user about a past episode of pain and then has the user rate their perception of the robot's empathy. We compare our proposed model to one that only generates non-affective grounding cues in a between-subjects experiment. Findings demonstrate that empathic grounding increases user perceptions of empathy, understanding, emotional intelligence, and trust. Our work highlights the role of emotion awareness and multimodality in generating appropriate grounding moves for conversational agents.
