> Strategic Demand-Planning in Wireless Networks: Can Generative-AI Save Spectrum and Energy?

# 摘要

> 无线通信与人工智能携手共进，彼此促进，共同发展。特别是在6G技术的研发中，这种协同效应尤为显著，6G被设想为AI原生技术。生成式AI（GenAI）作为一种新兴技术，能够创造多样化的输出，如文本、图像和视频，为无线通信带来巨大潜力。传统AI技术主要用于预测、分类和优化，而GenAI则展现出更多可能性。本文探讨了通过需求标签化、塑造和重新安排的战略需求规划，特别是提出GenAI作为推动无线网络需求塑造的有力工具。具体而言，GenAI能够压缩和转换内容，例如将视频转换为文本，从而在多种场景下提升网络性能，包括小区切换、用户关联、负载平衡、干扰管理和灾难管理。这使得GenAI在节能和节省频谱方面发挥作用。随着AI技术的进步，包括大型语言模型和专为AI设计的强大硬件，如AI加速器，通过GenAI进行需求塑造的概念变得更加重要。同时，GenAI在用户终端上的应用也使得这一概念的实施更为直接和可行。

> Wireless communications advance hand-in-hand with artificial intelligence (AI), indicating an interconnected advancement where each facilitates and benefits from the other. This synergy is particularly evident in the development of the sixth-generation technology standard for mobile networks (6G), envisioned to be AI-native. Generative-AI (GenAI), a novel technology capable of producing various types of outputs, including text, images, and videos, offers significant potential for wireless communications, with its distinctive features. Traditionally, conventional AI techniques have been employed for predictions, classifications, and optimization, while GenAI has more to offer. This article introduces the concept of strategic demand-planning through demand-labeling, demand-shaping, and demand-rescheduling. Accordingly, GenAI is proposed as a powerful tool to facilitate demand-shaping in wireless networks. More specifically, GenAI is used to compress and convert the content of various kind (e.g., from a higher bandwidth mode to a lower one, such as from a video to text), which subsequently enhances performance of wireless networks in various usage scenarios such as cell-switching, user association and load balancing, interference management, and disaster scenarios management. Therefore, GenAI can serve a function in saving energy and spectrum in wireless networks. With recent advancements in AI, including sophisticated algorithms like large-language-models and the development of more powerful hardware built exclusively for AI tasks, such as AI accelerators, the concept of demand-planning, particularly demand-shaping through GenAI, becomes increasingly relevant. Furthermore, recent efforts to make GenAI accessible on devices, such as user terminals, make the implementation of this concept even more straightforward and feasible.
