# 摘要

> 本论文旨在引领读者深入对话研究领域，特别是我自博士论文以来的学术探索。从模块化架构到端到端深度神经网络，我不仅分享了作为研究助理的经验，还展示了近年来我所指导的研究成果。简述当前对话代理的研究前沿后，我重点介绍了在任务导向对话（TOD）中的个人贡献，并深入探讨了对话问答领域，包括Thibault Cordier、Sebastien Montella和Quentin Brabant的研究工作。最后，我详述了关于大型语言模型在任务导向对话及多模态任务导向对话中的科学项目。

> In this dissertation I would like to guide the reader to the research on dialogue but more precisely the research I have conducted during my career since my PhD thesis. Starting from modular architectures with machine learning/deep learning and reinforcement learning to end-to-end deep neural networks. Besides my work as research associate, I also present the work I have supervised in the last years.
  I review briefly the state of the art and highlight the open research problems on conversational agents. Afterwards, I present my contribution to Task-Oriented Dialogues (TOD), both as research associate and as the industrial supervisor of CIFRE theses.  I discuss conversational QA. Particularly, I present the work of two PhD candidates Thibault Cordier and Sebastien Montella; as well as the work of the young researcher Quentin Brabant. Finally, I present the scientific project, where I discuss about Large Language Models (LLMs) for Task-Oriented Dialogue and Multimodal Task-Oriented Dialogue.
