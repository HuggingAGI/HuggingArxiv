> Automatic Adaptation Rule Optimization via Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 基于规则的自适应方法因其易读性和快速响应而成为自适应的基础。然而，构建高效且稳健的适应规则颇具挑战，因其需在复杂变量空间中寻找最佳设计。本文尝试借助大型语言模型（LLM）的常识与推理能力，将其作为优化工具来构建和优化适应规则。初步实验结果显示，该方法在SWIM中既展现了其有效性，也揭示了其局限性。

> Rule-based adaptation is a foundational approach to self-adaptation, characterized by its human readability and rapid response. However, building high-performance and robust adaptation rules is often a challenge because it essentially involves searching the optimal design in a complex (variables) space. In response, this paper attempt to employ large language models (LLMs) as a optimizer to construct and optimize adaptation rules, leveraging the common sense and reasoning capabilities inherent in LLMs. Preliminary experiments conducted in SWIM have validated the effectiveness and limitation of our method.
