# 摘要

> 本研究创新性地利用 LLM 的预测能力，提出了一种革命性的同声传译方法。通过预测发言并在树状结构中扩展多种可能性，该算法实现了实时翻译，展现出前所未有的灵活性和适应性，有望更有效地克服语言结构差异。理论分析和示例表明，这种方法能实现自然流畅的翻译，且延迟极低。本文旨在与学术界分享这一创新理念，推动该领域的深入研究。我们深入探讨了该技术的理论基础、潜在优势及实施挑战，视其为实现多语言沟通民主化的关键一步。

> This study introduces a groundbreaking approach to simultaneous interpretation by directly leveraging the predictive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We present a novel algorithm that generates real-time translations by predicting speaker utterances and expanding multiple possibilities in a tree-like structure. This method demonstrates unprecedented flexibility and adaptability, potentially overcoming the structural differences between languages more effectively than existing systems. Our theoretical analysis, supported by illustrative examples, suggests that this approach could lead to more natural and fluent translations with minimal latency. The primary purpose of this paper is to share this innovative concept with the academic community, stimulating further research and development in this field. We discuss the theoretical foundations, potential advantages, and implementation challenges of this technique, positioning it as a significant step towards democratizing multilingual communication.
