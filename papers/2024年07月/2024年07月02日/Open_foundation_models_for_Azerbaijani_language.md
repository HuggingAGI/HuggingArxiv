> Open foundation models for Azerbaijani language

# 摘要

> 随着多语言大型语言模型的兴起，阿塞拜疆语的理解与生成系统得到了发展，但多数生产级系统仍依赖GPT-4等云解决方案。虽然已有尝试为阿塞拜疆语构建开放基础模型，但因缺乏系统性基准测试而未广泛应用。本文致力于推广阿塞拜疆语的开源基础模型，并介绍了大型文本语料库、仅编码器语言模型、评估用标记数据集及全面的开源模型评估。

> The emergence of multilingual large language models has enabled the development of language understanding and generation systems in Azerbaijani. However, most of the production-grade systems rely on cloud solutions, such as GPT-4. While there have been several attempts to develop open foundation models for Azerbaijani, these works have not found their way into common use due to a lack of systemic benchmarking. This paper encompasses several lines of work that promote open-source foundation models for Azerbaijani. We introduce (1) a large text corpus for Azerbaijani, (2) a family of encoder-only language models trained on this dataset, (3) labeled datasets for evaluating these models, and (4) extensive evaluation that covers all major open-source models with Azerbaijani support.
