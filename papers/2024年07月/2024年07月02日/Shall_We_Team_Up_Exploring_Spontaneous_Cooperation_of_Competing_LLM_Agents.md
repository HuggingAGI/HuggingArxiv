> Shall We Team Up: Exploring Spontaneous Cooperation of Competing LLM Agents

# 摘要

> 最新研究揭示，由大型语言模型（LLM）支持的智能体不仅能模拟人类行为和社会运作，还能在缺乏明确指示时自行建立合作关系。通过三项案例研究，我们发现LLM智能体甚至能在竞争情境中自发协作，这不仅证实了它们模仿人类社会竞争与合作行为的能力，也为计算社会科学的发展提供了新视角。具体而言，LLM智能体有潜力被用于模拟包含自发协作在内的人类社交互动，为我们理解社会现象提供了新的视角。相关研究的源代码已在 https://github.com/wuzengqing001225/SABM_ShallWeTalk 上公开。

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been utilized in social simulations, where they are often guided by carefully crafted instructions to stably exhibit human-like behaviors during simulations. Nevertheless, we doubt the necessity of shaping agents' behaviors for accurate social simulations. Instead, this paper emphasizes the importance of spontaneous phenomena, wherein agents deeply engage in contexts and make adaptive decisions without explicit directions. We explored spontaneous cooperation across three competitive scenarios and successfully simulated the gradual emergence of cooperation, findings that align closely with human behavioral data. This approach not only aids the computational social science community in bridging the gap between simulations and real-world dynamics but also offers the AI community a novel method to assess LLMs' capability of deliberate reasoning.
