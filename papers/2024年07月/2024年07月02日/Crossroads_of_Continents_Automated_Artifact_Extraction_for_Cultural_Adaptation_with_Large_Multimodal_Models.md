> Crossroads of Continents: Automated Artifact Extraction for Cultural Adaptation with Large Multimodal Models

# 摘要

> 本研究通过三阶段全面考察了大型多模态模型（LMMs）在文化识别、文化表征准确性及跨文化内容适应能力方面的表现。首先，我们推出了Dalle Street数据集，由DALL-E 3生成并经人工验证，涵盖67国及10类概念的9,935张图片。研究发现，无论是开放还是闭源模型，在次区域文化理解上均存在差异。随后，通过文物提取任务深入评估模型文化理解力，识别出逾18,000件各国相关文物。最终，我们设计了CultureAdapt流水线，实现图像的跨文化适应。研究揭示了LMMs在文化处理上的细微差别，凸显了构建文化感知系统的重要性。相关数据集与代码已公开于https://github.com/iamshnoo/crossroads。

> In this work, we present a comprehensive three-phase study to examine (1) the effectiveness of large multimodal models (LMMs) in recognizing cultural contexts; (2) the accuracy of their representations of diverse cultures; and (3) their ability to adapt content across cultural boundaries. We first introduce Dalle Street, a large-scale dataset generated by DALL-E 3 and validated by humans, containing 9,935 images of 67 countries and 10 concept classes. We reveal disparities in cultural understanding at the sub-region level with both open-weight (LLaVA) and closed-source (GPT-4V) models on Dalle Street and other existing benchmarks. Next, we assess models' deeper culture understanding by an artifact extraction task and identify over 18,000 artifacts associated with different countries. Finally, we propose a highly composable pipeline, CultureAdapt, to adapt images from culture to culture. Our findings reveal a nuanced picture of the cultural competence of LMMs, highlighting the need to develop culture-aware systems.
