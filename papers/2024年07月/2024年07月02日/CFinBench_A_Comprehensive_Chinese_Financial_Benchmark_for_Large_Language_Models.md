> CFinBench: A Comprehensive Chinese Financial Benchmark for Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）在NLP任务上表现卓越，但在金融等特定领域的应用潜力仍待挖掘。本文介绍的CFinBench，是一个专为评估LLMs在中国金融知识掌握程度而设计的全面基准。我们根据中国金融从业者的职业路径，从四个维度构建评估体系：金融学科知识、资格认证、实践操作和法律法规。CFinBench包含99,100道题目，覆盖43个细分领域，题型多样。实验结果表明，GPT4及部分中国定制模型表现突出，最高平均准确率达60.16%，凸显了CFinBench的挑战性。数据集与评估代码已公开，详情访问https://cfinbench.github.io/。

> Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on various NLP tasks, yet their potential in more challenging and domain-specific task, such as finance, has not been fully explored. In this paper, we present CFinBench: a meticulously crafted, the most comprehensive evaluation benchmark to date, for assessing the financial knowledge of LLMs under Chinese context. In practice, to better align with the career trajectory of Chinese financial practitioners, we build a systematic evaluation from 4 first-level categories: (1) Financial Subject: whether LLMs can memorize the necessary basic knowledge of financial subjects, such as economics, statistics and auditing. (2) Financial Qualification: whether LLMs can obtain the needed financial qualified certifications, such as certified public accountant, securities qualification and banking qualification. (3) Financial Practice: whether LLMs can fulfill the practical financial jobs, such as tax consultant, junior accountant and securities analyst. (4) Financial Law: whether LLMs can meet the requirement of financial laws and regulations, such as tax law, insurance law and economic law. CFinBench comprises 99,100 questions spanning 43 second-level categories with 3 question types: single-choice, multiple-choice and judgment. We conduct extensive experiments of 50 representative LLMs with various model size on CFinBench. The results show that GPT4 and some Chinese-oriented models lead the benchmark, with the highest average accuracy being 60.16%, highlighting the challenge presented by CFinBench. The dataset and evaluation code are available at https://cfinbench.github.io/.
