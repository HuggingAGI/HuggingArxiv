# 摘要

> 推荐系统已成为信息搜索的关键解决方案。我们提出的BoNMF模型，融合了BoBERTa的自然语言处理能力、ViT的计算机视觉技术及神经矩阵分解，有效捕捉用户与项目的深层特征。通过与低维用户-项目ID矩阵的交互，神经网络精准输出推荐。实验证明，BoNMF在大型数据集上表现卓越，大幅提升推荐精度。

> Recommendation systems have become an important solution to information search problems. This article proposes a neural matrix factorization recommendation system model based on the multimodal large language model called BoNMF. This model combines BoBERTa's powerful capabilities in natural language processing, ViT in computer in vision, and neural matrix decomposition technology. By capturing the potential characteristics of users and items, and after interacting with a low-dimensional matrix composed of user and item IDs, the neural network outputs the results. recommend. Cold start and ablation experimental results show that the BoNMF model exhibits excellent performance on large public data sets and significantly improves the accuracy of recommendations.
