> Vox Populi, Vox AI? Using Language Models to Estimate German Public Opinion

# 摘要

> 随着大型语言模型 (LLM) 的进步，人们开始探讨 LLM 生成的“合成样本”是否能替代传统调查。一些美国研究显示，LLM 模拟的调查响应与实际数据相符。但这种匹配的可推广性受限于目标人群与 LLM 训练数据的关系。本研究探索 LLM 在德国的公众意见预测能力，特别是投票选择。我们使用 GPT-3.5 生成与德国选举研究受访者特征相符的合成样本，并预测其投票选择，发现 GPT-3.5 对绿党和左派有偏见，虽能捕捉典型选民趋势，但未能全面理解影响个体选择的复杂因素。这项研究揭示了 LLM 在公众意见研究中的局限，强调了其应用的挑战。

> The recent development of large language models (LLMs) has spurred discussions about whether LLM-generated "synthetic samples" could complement or replace traditional surveys, considering their training data potentially reflects attitudes and behaviors prevalent in the population. A number of mostly US-based studies have prompted LLMs to mimic survey respondents, with some of them finding that the responses closely match the survey data. However, several contextual factors related to the relationship between the respective target population and LLM training data might affect the generalizability of such findings. In this study, we investigate the extent to which LLMs can estimate public opinion in Germany, using the example of vote choice. We generate a synthetic sample of personas matching the individual characteristics of the 2017 German Longitudinal Election Study respondents. We ask the LLM GPT-3.5 to predict each respondent's vote choice and compare these predictions to the survey-based estimates on the aggregate and subgroup levels. We find that GPT-3.5 does not predict citizens' vote choice accurately, exhibiting a bias towards the Green and Left parties. While the LLM captures the tendencies of "typical" voter subgroups, such as partisans, it misses the multifaceted factors swaying individual voter choices. By examining the LLM-based prediction of voting behavior in a new context, our study contributes to the growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be leveraged for studying public opinion. The findings point to disparities in opinion representation in LLMs and underscore the limitations in applying them for public opinion estimation.
