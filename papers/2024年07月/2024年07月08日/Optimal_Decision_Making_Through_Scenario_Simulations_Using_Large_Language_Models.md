> Optimal Decision Making Through Scenario Simulations Using Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLM）的迅猛发展极大地拓宽了其在各领域的应用，重塑了我们处理复杂问题的方式。这些模型最初仅用于预测文本中的下一个词，如今已能深入理解并回应查询的语境。现在，LLM 能够轻松完成撰写论文、创作诗歌、编写故事甚至开发软件代码等曾经艰巨的任务。随着其能力的不断提升，人们对它们在更高级领域的表现也寄予厚望。然而，LLM 在需要精细决策的场景中仍面临挑战，如旅行规划或多个选项的选择。这些任务要求对多种结果有深刻理解，并能预测不同选择的后果，而这超出了 LLM 的常规能力范围。本文提出了一种创新方法，通过让 LLM 向用户请求多个潜在选项及其参数，引入了一个集成了优化函数的动态决策框架。该函数能分析选项、模拟结果，并根据预设标准选出最佳方案。借助此方法，LLM 能为复杂的多变量问题提供定制的最优解，大幅提升其实际应用的效能。这一方法不仅扩展了 LLM 的功能边界，还为构建能支持复杂决策的更智能系统奠定了基础。

> The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has markedly expanded their application across diverse domains, transforming how complex problems are approached and solved. Initially conceived to predict subsequent words in texts, these models have transcended their original design to comprehend and respond to the underlying contexts of queries. Today, LLMs routinely perform tasks that once seemed formidable, such as writing essays, poems, stories, and even developing software code. As their capabilities continue to grow, so too do the expectations of their performance in even more sophisticated domains.
  Despite these advancements, LLMs still encounter significant challenges, particularly in scenarios requiring intricate decision-making, such as planning trips or choosing among multiple viable options. These tasks often demand a nuanced understanding of various outcomes and the ability to predict the consequences of different choices, which are currently outside the typical operational scope of LLMs.
  This paper proposes an innovative approach to bridge this capability gap. By enabling LLMs to request multiple potential options and their respective parameters from users, our system introduces a dynamic framework that integrates an optimization function within the decision-making process. This function is designed to analyze the provided options, simulate potential outcomes, and determine the most advantageous solution based on a set of predefined criteria. By harnessing this methodology, LLMs can offer tailored, optimal solutions to complex, multi-variable problems, significantly enhancing their utility and effectiveness in real-world applications. This approach not only expands the functional envelope of LLMs but also paves the way for more autonomous and intelligent systems capable of supporting sophisticated decision-making tasks.
