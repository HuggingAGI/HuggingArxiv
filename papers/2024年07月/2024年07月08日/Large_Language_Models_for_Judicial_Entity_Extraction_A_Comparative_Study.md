> Large Language Models for Judicial Entity Extraction: A Comparative Study

# 摘要

> 领域特定实体识别在法律领域至关重要，支持多种应用，如问答系统、文本摘要等，特别是在案例法文档中。最新进展显示，大型语言模型在自然语言处理中表现出色，能从专业文本中精准识别和分类特定实体。本研究聚焦于大型语言模型在案例法文档中识别特定实体的能力，特别是处理语言复杂性和上下文变化的能力。研究评估了包括Meta AI 3、Mistral和Gemma在内的先进模型，在提取印度司法文本相关事实方面的表现。Mistral和Gemma表现卓越，精确度和召回率均衡，对实体识别至关重要。这些成果不仅证实了大型语言模型在司法领域的价值，还展示了它们如何通过生成精确、有序的数据，加速科学研究，为深入分析提供支持。

> Domain-specific Entity Recognition holds significant importance in legal contexts, serving as a fundamental task that supports various applications such as question-answering systems, text summarization, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval specifically within case law documents. Recent advancements have highlighted the efficacy of Large Language Models in natural language processing tasks, demonstrating their capability to accurately detect and classify domain-specific facts (entities) from specialized texts like clinical and financial documents. This research investigates the application of Large Language Models in identifying domain-specific entities (e.g., courts, petitioner, judge, lawyer, respondents, FIR nos.) within case law documents, with a specific focus on their aptitude for handling domain-specific language complexity and contextual variations. The study evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art Large Language Model architectures, including Large Language Model Meta AI 3, Mistral, and Gemma, in the context of extracting judicial facts tailored to Indian judicial texts. Mistral and Gemma emerged as the top-performing models, showcasing balanced precision and recall crucial for accurate entity identification. These findings confirm the value of Large Language Models in judicial documents and demonstrate how they can facilitate and quicken scientific research by producing precise, organised data outputs that are appropriate for in-depth examination.
