> Tabular Data Augmentation for Machine Learning: Progress and Prospects of Embracing Generative AI

# 摘要

> 机器学习在表格数据处理中无处不在，但获取高质量的训练数据仍是一大挑战。为此，表格数据增强（TDA）应运而生，通过引入额外数据提升原始表格，进而优化机器学习任务。近期，生成AI在TDA中的应用日益受到关注。本文旨在全面回顾TDA的发展现状与未来趋势，尤其聚焦于生成AI的最新动态。我们构建了TDA流程的架构框架，涵盖预处理、增强和后处理三大环节。预处理阶段包括错误校正、表格注释等准备工作；增强阶段则细分为基于检索与基于生成的两大方法，并按操作粒度进一步划分；后处理阶段则侧重于数据集的评估与优化。此外，我们还展望了TDA在生成AI时代的发展机遇，并持续更新相关论文与资源于GitHub仓库，以追踪领域前沿进展。

> Machine learning (ML) on tabular data is ubiquitous, yet obtaining abundant high-quality tabular data for model training remains a significant obstacle. Numerous works have focused on tabular data augmentation (TDA) to enhance the original table with additional data, thereby improving downstream ML tasks. Recently, there has been a growing interest in leveraging the capabilities of generative AI for TDA. Therefore, we believe it is time to provide a comprehensive review of the progress and future prospects of TDA, with a particular emphasis on the trending generative AI. Specifically, we present an architectural view of the TDA pipeline, comprising three main procedures: pre-augmentation, augmentation, and post-augmentation. Pre-augmentation encompasses preparation tasks that facilitate subsequent TDA, including error handling, table annotation, table simplification, table representation, table indexing, table navigation, schema matching, and entity matching. Augmentation systematically analyzes current TDA methods, categorized into retrieval-based methods, which retrieve external data, and generation-based methods, which generate synthetic data. We further subdivide these methods based on the granularity of the augmentation process at the row, column, cell, and table levels. Post-augmentation focuses on the datasets, evaluation and optimization aspects of TDA. We also summarize current trends and future directions for TDA, highlighting promising opportunities in the era of generative AI. In addition, the accompanying papers and related resources are continuously updated and maintained in the GitHub repository at https://github.com/SuDIS-ZJU/awesome-tabular-data-augmentation to reflect ongoing advancements in the field.
