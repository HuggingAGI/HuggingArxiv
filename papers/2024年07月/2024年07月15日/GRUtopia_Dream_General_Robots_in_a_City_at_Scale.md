# 摘要

> 近期研究深入探索了具身AI的规模法则。鉴于现实数据收集的高昂成本，Sim2Real范式被视为扩展具身学习的关键。本文推出的GRUtopia项目，是首个专为多类机器人设计的模拟交互3D社会。其亮点包括：（a）GRScenes数据集，包含十万精细交互场景，可自由组合成城市级环境，覆盖89种场景，弥补了服务型机器人的应用环境空白。（b）GRResidents系统，由LLM驱动的NPC，模拟社交互动、任务生成与分配，为具身AI提供真实社交场景。（c）GRBench基准，重点支持腿式机器人，设定物体导航、社交导航及操作等适中难度任务。期望本项目能缓解高质量数据稀缺问题，并全面评估具身AI研究。项目详情见https://github.com/OpenRobotLab/GRUtopia。

> Recent works have been exploring the scaling laws in the field of Embodied AI. Given the prohibitive costs of collecting real-world data, we believe the Simulation-to-Real (Sim2Real) paradigm is a crucial step for scaling the learning of embodied models. This paper introduces project GRUtopia, the first simulated interactive 3D society designed for various robots. It features several advancements: (a) The scene dataset, GRScenes, includes 100k interactive, finely annotated scenes, which can be freely combined into city-scale environments. In contrast to previous works mainly focusing on home, GRScenes covers 89 diverse scene categories, bridging the gap of service-oriented environments where general robots would be initially deployed. (b) GRResidents, a Large Language Model (LLM) driven Non-Player Character (NPC) system that is responsible for social interaction, task generation, and task assignment, thus simulating social scenarios for embodied AI applications. (c) The benchmark, GRBench, supports various robots but focuses on legged robots as primary agents and poses moderately challenging tasks involving Object Loco-Navigation, Social Loco-Navigation, and Loco-Manipulation. We hope that this work can alleviate the scarcity of high-quality data in this field and provide a more comprehensive assessment of Embodied AI research.
