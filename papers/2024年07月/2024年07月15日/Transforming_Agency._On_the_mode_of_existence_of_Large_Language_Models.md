> Transforming Agency. On the mode of existence of Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 本文深入探讨了 ChatGPT 等大型语言模型（LLM）的本体论特性，特别聚焦于其作为代理的角色。我们详细阐述了 LLM 的架构、处理流程及训练机制，以及如何通过扩展将其转化为类似代理的系统。经过严谨分析，我们发现，根据具身心灵理论，LLM 在个体性、规范性和交互不对称性方面均未达到自主代理的标准。因此，我们提出 ChatGPT 应被视为一种对话者或语言自动机，一个能言善辩的图书馆，虽无自主代理能力，却能在非目的性但结构化、有限制的任务中展现其表演性。在与人类的互动中，人机交互的“幽灵”特质使得与 LLM 的真实对话成为可能。尽管缺乏感觉运动和生物实体，LLM 的文本和计算实体却深刻地重塑了人类代理的形式，创造出一种介于有意代理和传统技术工具性之间的中介代理形态。

> This paper investigates the ontological characterization of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. Between inflationary and deflationary accounts, we pay special attention to their status as agents. This requires explaining in detail the architecture, processing, and training procedures that enable LLMs to display their capacities, and the extensions used to turn LLMs into agent-like systems. After a systematic analysis we conclude that a LLM fails to meet necessary and sufficient conditions for autonomous agency in the light of embodied theories of mind: the individuality condition (it is not the product of its own activity, it is not even directly affected by it), the normativity condition (it does not generate its own norms or goals), and, partially the interactional asymmetry condition (it is not the origin and sustained source of its interaction with the environment). If not agents, then ... what are LLMs? We argue that ChatGPT should be characterized as an interlocutor or linguistic automaton, a library-that-talks, devoid of (autonomous) agency, but capable to engage performatively on non-purposeful yet purpose-structured and purpose-bounded tasks. When interacting with humans, a "ghostly" component of the human-machine interaction makes it possible to enact genuine conversational experiences with LLMs. Despite their lack of sensorimotor and biological embodiment, LLMs textual embodiment (the training corpus) and resource-hungry computational embodiment, significantly transform existing forms of human agency. Beyond assisted and extended agency, the LLM-human coupling can produce midtended forms of agency, closer to the production of intentional agency than to the extended instrumentality of any previous technologies.
