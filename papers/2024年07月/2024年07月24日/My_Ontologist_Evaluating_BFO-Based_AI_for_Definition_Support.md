> My Ontologist: Evaluating BFO-Based AI for Definition Support

# 摘要

> 生成式AI，如GPT-3.5的发布，极大地拓展了LLM的应用潜力，涵盖本体论开发和知识图谱构建。本体论和知识图谱对于实现互操作性和自动化推理至关重要，但当前研究往往忽视了从BFO等上层框架延伸的本体论生成，可能导致不可整合的本体论孤岛。本研究探索了GPT-4在支持BFO训练的本体论学者方面的能力，通过开发“我的本体论学者”模型，我们尝试生成符合BFO的本体论。尽管My Ontologist 3.0在遵循结构化规则方面显示出潜力，但GPT-4o的发布改变了模型行为，影响了进展。研究强调了LLM生成的本体论与顶级标准对齐的重要性，并揭示了在本体论工程中整合AI能力的复杂性。

> Generative artificial intelligence (AI), exemplified by the release of GPT-3.5 in 2022, has significantly advanced the potential applications of large language models (LLMs), including in the realms of ontology development and knowledge graph creation. Ontologies, which are structured frameworks for organizing information, and knowledge graphs, which combine ontologies with actual data, are essential for enabling interoperability and automated reasoning. However, current research has largely overlooked the generation of ontologies extending from established upper-level frameworks like the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), risking the creation of non-integrable ontology silos. This study explores the extent to which LLMs, particularly GPT-4, can support ontologists trained in BFO. Through iterative development of a specialized GPT model named "My Ontologist," we aimed to generate BFO-conformant ontologies. Initial versions faced challenges in maintaining definition conventions and leveraging foundational texts effectively. My Ontologist 3.0 showed promise by adhering to structured rules and modular ontology suites, yet the release of GPT-4o disrupted this progress by altering the model's behavior. Our findings underscore the importance of aligning LLM-generated ontologies with top-level standards and highlight the complexities of integrating evolving AI capabilities in ontology engineering.
