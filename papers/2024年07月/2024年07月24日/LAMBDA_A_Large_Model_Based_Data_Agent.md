# 摘要

> 我们推出了“LAMBDA”，一款创新的开源、无代码多代理数据分析系统，充分利用大型模型的优势。LAMBDA通过创新设计的数据代理，以自然语言进行迭代和生成操作，旨在应对复杂数据驱动应用中的数据分析挑战。系统核心包含两个关键角色：程序员和检查员，二者协同工作，确保无缝衔接。程序员根据用户指令和领域知识生成代码，并借助高级模型进行增强；检查员则在必要时负责代码调试。为确保系统的鲁棒性和应对不利情况，LAMBDA提供了用户界面，允许用户直接介入操作循环。此外，LAMBDA通过知识集成机制，灵活整合外部模型和算法，满足个性化数据分析需求。LAMBDA在多个机器学习数据集上展现了卓越性能，有望通过人机智能的无缝融合，提升数据科学实践和分析范式，使其更加普及、高效。相关案例研究详见\url{https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/cmfai/lambda.html}。

> We introduce ``LAMBDA," a novel open-source, code-free multi-agent data analysis system that that harnesses the power of large models. LAMBDA is designed to address data analysis challenges in complex data-driven applications through the use of innovatively designed data agents that operate iteratively and generatively using natural language. At the core of LAMBDA are two key agent roles: the programmer and the inspector, which are engineered to work together seamlessly. Specifically, the programmer generates code based on the user's instructions and domain-specific knowledge, enhanced by advanced models. Meanwhile, the inspector debugs the code when necessary. To ensure robustness and handle adverse scenarios, LAMBDA features a user interface that allows direct user intervention in the operational loop. Additionally, LAMBDA can flexibly integrate external models and algorithms through our knowledge integration mechanism, catering to the needs of customized data analysis. LAMBDA has demonstrated strong performance on various machine learning datasets. It has the potential to enhance data science practice and analysis paradigm by seamlessly integrating human and artificial intelligence, making it more accessible, effective, and efficient for individuals from diverse backgrounds. The strong performance of LAMBDA in solving data science problems is demonstrated in several case studies, which are presented at \url{https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/cmfai/lambda.html}.
