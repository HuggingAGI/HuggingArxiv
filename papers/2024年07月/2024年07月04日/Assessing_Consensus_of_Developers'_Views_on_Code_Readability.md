> Assessing Consensus of Developers' Views on Code Readability

# 摘要

> 随着大型语言模型（LLM）的兴起，如 Copilot 和 JetBrains AI 助手等工具已显著提升开发者效率。然而，开发者如今更多时间用于代码审查而非编写，凸显了代码可读性的关键作用。我们的先前研究揭示现有模型未能准确反映开发者对可读性的理解，且开发者间共识不足，这促使我们深入探索。  为此，我们调研了10位经验相当的 Java 开发者，旨在探求他们对代码可读性的共识。结果显示，开发者们在评估可读性时展现出高度一致，并明确了影响可读性的关键代码特征。本研究不仅阐明了 LLM 环境下的代码可读性问题，更为模型如何契合开发者认知提供了洞见，助力 AI 时代软件开发的优化。

> The rapid rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has changed software development, with tools like Copilot, JetBrains AI Assistant, and others boosting developers' productivity. However, developers now spend more time reviewing code than writing it, highlighting the importance of Code Readability for code comprehension. Our previous research found that existing Code Readability models were inaccurate in representing developers' notions and revealed a low consensus among developers, highlighting a need for further investigations in this field.
  Building on this, we surveyed 10 Java developers with similar coding experience to evaluate their consensus on Code Readability assessments and related aspects. We found significant agreement among developers on Code Readability evaluations and identified specific code aspects strongly correlated with Code Readability. Overall, our study sheds light on Code Readability within LLM contexts, offering insights into how these models can align with developers' perceptions of Code Readability, enhancing software development in the AI era.
