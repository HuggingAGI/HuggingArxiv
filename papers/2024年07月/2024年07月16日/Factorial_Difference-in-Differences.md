# 摘要

> 在社会科学领域，研究者常利用差异-in-差异（DID）方法来揭示因果关系，通过基线因素的横截面差异和事件暴露的时间变化。本文提出的因子DID（FDID）方法，与传统DID不同，它不依赖于事件后未受影响的控制组。我们详细阐述了FDID的研究设计，包括数据结构、估计量和识别假设。FDID被视为包含基线因素$G$和事件暴露$Z$的双因素设计，其中效应修饰和因果相互作用分别指$G$对$Z$效应的影响。在无预期和平行趋势的假设下，DID仅能识别$G$的效应修饰，而通过引入因子平行趋势假设，可以进一步识别因果相互作用。此外，经典DID可视为FDID的特例，通过增加排除限制假设来统一这两种方法。我们还扩展了FDID框架，使其适应条件平行趋势和多时间周期，并明确了进行回归分析所需的假设。通过经济学和政治学的实例，我们展示了FDID的应用，并提出了改进其实践和解释的建议。

Abstract:In many social science applications, researchers use the difference-in-differences (DID) estimator to establish causal relationships, exploiting cross-sectional variation in a baseline factor and temporal variation in exposure to an event that presumably may affect all units. This approach, which we term factorial DID (FDID), differs from canonical DID in that it lacks a clean control group unexposed to the event after the event occurs. In this paper, we clarify FDID as a research design in terms of its data structure, feasible estimands, and identifying assumptions that allow the DID estimator to recover these estimands. We frame FDID as a factorial design with two factors: the baseline factor, denoted by $G$, and the exposure level to the event, denoted by $Z$, and define the effect modification and causal interaction as the associative and causal effects of $G$ on the effect of $Z$, respectively. We show that under the canonical no anticipation and parallel trends assumptions, the DID estimator identifies only the effect modification of $G$ in FDID, and propose an additional factorial parallel trends assumption to identify the causal interaction. Moreover, we show that the canonical DID research design can be reframed as a special case of the FDID research design with an additional exclusion restriction assumption, thereby reconciling the two approaches. We extend this framework to allow conditionally valid parallel trends assumptions and multiple time periods, and clarify assumptions required to justify regression analysis under FDID. We illustrate these findings with empirical examples from economics and political science, and provide recommendations for improving practice and interpretation under FDID.
