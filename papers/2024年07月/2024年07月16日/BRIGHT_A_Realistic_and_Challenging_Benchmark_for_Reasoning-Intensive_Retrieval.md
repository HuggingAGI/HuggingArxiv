> BRIGHT: A Realistic and Challenging Benchmark for Reasoning-Intensive Retrieval

# 摘要

> 现有的检索基准多聚焦于简单的信息查询，而面对复杂查询时，深入推理变得至关重要。为此，我们推出了BRIGHT，首个要求深度推理的文本检索基准，涵盖了从经济学到软件工程等多个领域的1,398个真实查询。评估显示，顶尖检索模型在BRIGHT上的表现也大打折扣。通过引入大型语言模型的思维链推理，我们成功提升了检索性能。BRIGHT还展现了对抗预训练数据泄露的稳健性。我们期待BRIGHT能推动检索系统在更复杂场景中的研究。相关代码和数据已公开，详情请访问https://brightbenchmark.github.io。

> Existing retrieval benchmarks primarily consist of information-seeking queries (e.g., aggregated questions from search engines) where keyword or semantic-based retrieval is usually sufficient. However, many complex real-world queries require in-depth reasoning to identify relevant documents that go beyond surface form matching. For example, finding documentation for a coding question requires understanding the logic and syntax of the functions involved. To better benchmark retrieval on such challenging queries, we introduce BRIGHT, the first text retrieval benchmark that requires intensive reasoning to retrieve relevant documents. BRIGHT is constructed from the 1,398 real-world queries collected from diverse domains (such as economics, psychology, robotics, software engineering, earth sciences, etc.), sourced from naturally occurring or carefully curated human data. Extensive evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art retrieval models perform poorly on BRIGHT. The leading model on the MTEB leaderboard [38 ], which achieves a score of 59.0 nDCG@10,2 produces a score of nDCG@10 of 18.0 on BRIGHT. We further demonstrate that augmenting queries with Chain-of-Thought reasoning generated by large language models (LLMs) improves performance by up to 12.2 points. Moreover, BRIGHT is robust against data leakage during pretraining of the benchmarked models as we validate by showing similar performance even when documents from the benchmark are included in the training data. We believe that BRIGHT paves the way for future research on retrieval systems in more realistic and challenging settings. Our code and data are available at https://brightbenchmark.github.io.
