# 摘要

> 本文探讨了人工智能在农业中的应用，特别是通过智能农业机械管理咨询（CIAMM），旨在提升农业效率和可持续性。我们采用了一种创新方法，结合GPT-4和多轮提示工程，优化农业机械管理的决策过程。通过精心设计的提示，我们引导LLMs生成精准且符合上下文的输出。实验结果显示，我们的方法在准确性和相关性上均优于传统和前沿技术，如思维链（CoT）和思维的思维（ThoT）。这表明，先进的提示工程技术能显著增强AI在农业领域的应用效果。

> The integration of artificial intelligence into agricultural practices, specifically through Consultation on Intelligent Agricultural Machinery Management (CIAMM), has the potential to revolutionize efficiency and sustainability in farming. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs), particularly GPT-4, combined with multi-round prompt engineering to enhance decision-making processes in agricultural machinery management. We systematically developed and refined prompts to guide the LLMs in generating precise and contextually relevant outputs. Our approach was evaluated using a manually curated dataset from various online sources, and performance was assessed with accuracy and GPT-4 Scores. Comparative experiments were conducted using LLama-2-70B, ChatGPT, and GPT-4 models, alongside baseline and state-of-the-art methods such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Thought of Thought (ThoT). The results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms these approaches, achieving higher accuracy and relevance in generated responses. This paper highlights the potential of advanced prompt engineering techniques in improving the robustness and applicability of AI in agricultural contexts.
