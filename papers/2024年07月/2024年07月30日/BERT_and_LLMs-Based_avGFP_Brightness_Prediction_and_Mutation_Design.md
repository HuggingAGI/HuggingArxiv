# 摘要

> 本研究利用Transformer和大型语言模型（如GPT和Claude）预测Aequorea victoria绿色荧光蛋白（avGFP）的亮度，并设计更亮的突变体。为提高效率，我们采用机器学习技术，首先处理包含约140,000个蛋白质序列的数据集，其中约30,000个为avGFP序列。接着，构建并训练基于Transformer的预测模型，筛选和设计预期更亮的新avGFP突变体。研究分为两个阶段：首先，用BERT构建评分模型；其次，结合突变位点统计和大型语言模型筛选和生成突变体。通过分析预测结果，我们成功设计并筛选出10个新的高亮度avGFP序列。本研究不仅揭示了深度学习在蛋白质设计中的潜力，还通过整合大型语言模型的先验知识，为未来研究提供了新视角和方法。

> This study aims to utilize Transformer models and large language models (such as GPT and Claude) to predict the brightness of Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (avGFP) and design mutants with higher brightness. Considering the time and cost associated with traditional experimental screening methods, this study employs machine learning techniques to enhance research efficiency. We first read and preprocess a proprietary dataset containing approximately 140,000 protein sequences, including about 30,000 avGFP sequences. Subsequently, we constructed and trained a Transformer-based prediction model to screen and design new avGFP mutants that are expected to exhibit higher brightness.
  Our methodology consists of two primary stages: first, the construction of a scoring model using BERT, and second, the screening and generation of mutants using mutation site statistics and large language models. Through the analysis of predictive results, we designed and screened 10 new high-brightness avGFP sequences. This study not only demonstrates the potential of deep learning in protein design but also provides new perspectives and methodologies for future research by integrating prior knowledge from large language models.
