> Mimicking the Mavens: Agent-based Opinion Synthesis and Emotion Prediction for Social Media Influencers

# 摘要

> 本研究针对社交媒体上影响者的观点和公众情绪预测，提出了一种创新的计算框架，有效应对了在线沟通的复杂性。通过自动生成5W1H问题，我们为新兴新闻和热门话题定制了分析引擎，构建了60个领域的匿名意见领袖代理，并利用先进的LLM和RAG技术生成观点。实验显示，我们的5W1H模块获得了8.83/10的高分，影响者代理在评估中平均得分6.85/10。以“俄乌战争”为例，我们的方法不仅准确预测了关键影响者的观点，还成功匹配了各领域的实际情绪趋势。

> Predicting influencers' views and public sentiment on social media is crucial for anticipating societal trends and guiding strategic responses. This study introduces a novel computational framework to predict opinion leaders' perspectives and the emotive reactions of the populace, addressing the inherent challenges posed by the unstructured, context-sensitive, and heterogeneous nature of online communication. Our research introduces an innovative module that starts with the automatic 5W1H (Where, Who, When, What, Why, and How) questions formulation engine, tailored to emerging news stories and trending topics. We then build a total of 60 anonymous opinion leader agents in six domains and realize the views generation based on an enhanced large language model (LLM) coupled with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Subsequently, we synthesize the potential views of opinion leaders and predicted the emotional responses to different events. The efficacy of our automated 5W1H module is corroborated by an average GPT-4 score of 8.83/10, indicative of high fidelity. The influencer agents exhibit a consistent performance, achieving an average GPT-4 rating of 6.85/10 across evaluative metrics. Utilizing the 'Russia-Ukraine War' as a case study, our methodology accurately foresees key influencers' perspectives and aligns emotional predictions with real-world sentiment trends in various domains.
