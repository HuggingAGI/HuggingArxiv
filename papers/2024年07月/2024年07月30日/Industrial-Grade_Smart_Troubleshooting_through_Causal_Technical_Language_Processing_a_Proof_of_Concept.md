# 摘要

> 本文开发了一种基于经验回报记录中的技术语言的工业环境故障排除的因果诊断方法。该方法结合了大型语言模型的向量化语言知识和工业资产故障模式中的因果关联。我们提出了一种因果感知增强检索生成系统，并在预测性维护场景中进行了实验验证。最后，我们探讨了提升因果技术成熟度的策略，以应对工业复杂场景的稳健性挑战。

> This paper describes the development of a causal diagnosis approach for troubleshooting an industrial environment on the basis of the technical language expressed in Return on Experience records. The proposed method leverages the vectorized linguistic knowledge contained in the distributed representation of a Large Language Model, and the causal associations entailed by the embedded failure modes and mechanisms of the industrial assets. The paper presents the elementary but essential concepts of the solution, which is conceived as a causality-aware retrieval augmented generation system, and illustrates them experimentally on a real-world Predictive Maintenance setting. Finally, it discusses avenues of improvement for the maturity of the utilized causal technology to meet the robustness challenges of increasingly complex scenarios in the industry.
