> ViTime: A Visual Intelligence-Based Foundation Model for Time Series Forecasting

# 摘要

> 大型预训练模型在NLP和CV领域的成功，为TSF基础模型的构建带来了新思路。传统TSF模型依赖数值拟合，而人脑则擅长通过视觉序列预测未来。从仿生学视角看，直接处理数值序列可能并非AGI的最佳路径。本文提出的ViTime模型，通过视觉数据处理和创新的数据合成方法RealTS，突破了数值拟合的限制。实验显示，ViTime在多个新数据集上实现了顶尖的零-shot性能，甚至在某些情况下超越了最佳监督模型。这表明视觉智能能大幅提升时间序列分析与预测，为更先进、多功能的模型开辟了道路。ViTime框架代码已公开在https://github.com/IkeYang/ViTime。

> The success of large pretrained models in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) has opened new avenues for constructing foundation models for time series forecasting (TSF). Traditional TSF foundation models rely heavily on numerical data fitting. In contrast, the human brain is inherently skilled at processing visual information, prefer predicting future trends by observing visualized sequences. From a biomimetic perspective, utilizing models to directly process numerical sequences might not be the most effective route to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This paper proposes ViTime, a novel Visual Intelligence-based foundation model for TSF. ViTime overcomes the limitations of numerical time series data fitting by utilizing visual data processing paradigms and employs a innovative data synthesis method during training, called Real Time Series (RealTS). Experiments on a diverse set of previously unseen forecasting datasets demonstrate that ViTime achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, even surpassing the best individually trained supervised models in some situations. These findings suggest that visual intelligence can significantly enhance time series analysis and forecasting, paving the way for more advanced and versatile models in the field. The code for our framework is accessible at https://github.com/IkeYang/ViTime.
