> Combining Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 近年来，NLP 在 AI 应用中扮演了关键角色，如聊天机器人和语言翻译。LLM 的崛起显著提升了这些应用的性能，尤其在语言理解和生成方面。然而，LLM 仍面临幻觉和领域知识不足等挑战，这些问题可通过结合知识图谱（KGs）来缓解，KGs 以结构化方式捕捉实体间关系。LLM 与 KGs 的互补性推动了两者结合的趋势，以提升 AI 应用的可靠性。本研究分析了 28 篇相关论文，系统比较了基于 KG 的 LLM、LLM 驱动的 KGs 及混合方法，旨在为新入行的研究人员和希望深化理解 LLM 与 KGs 结合策略的学者提供全面视角，揭示关键趋势、创新技术及共同挑战。

> In recent years, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has played a significant role in various Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications such as chatbots, text generation, and language translation. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has greatly improved the performance of these applications, showing astonishing results in language understanding and generation. However, they still show some disadvantages, such as hallucinations and lack of domain-specific knowledge, that affect their performance in real-world tasks. These issues can be effectively mitigated by incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs), which organise information in structured formats that capture relationships between entities in a versatile and interpretable fashion. Likewise, the construction and validation of KGs present challenges that LLMs can help resolve. The complementary relationship between LLMs and KGs has led to a trend that combines these technologies to achieve trustworthy results. This work collected 28 papers outlining methods for KG-powered LLMs, LLM-based KGs, and LLM-KG hybrid approaches. We systematically analysed and compared these approaches to provide a comprehensive overview highlighting key trends, innovative techniques, and common challenges. This synthesis will benefit researchers new to the field and those seeking to deepen their understanding of how KGs and LLMs can be effectively combined to enhance AI applications capabilities.
