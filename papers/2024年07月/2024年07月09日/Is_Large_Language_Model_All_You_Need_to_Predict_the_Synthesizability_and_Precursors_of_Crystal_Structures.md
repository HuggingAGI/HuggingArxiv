> 为了弥合理论设计与实际合成之间的鸿沟，我们推出了晶体合成大型语言模型（CSLLM）框架。该框架包含三个LLM，分别用于预测晶体结构的合成能力、合成方法和前驱体。我们构建了一个涵盖140,120个晶体结构的详尽数据集，并创新了一种高效的晶体结构文本表示法，以优化LLM性能。合成能力LLM以98.6%的准确率领先，显著超越了传统基于热力学和动力学稳定性的筛选方法。方法LLM分类准确率达91.02%，前驱体LLM在预测前驱体方面成功率为80.2%。此外，我们设计了一个便捷的图形界面，支持从晶体结构文件自动预测合成能力和前驱体，助力新型功能材料的快速发现。

> Accessing the synthesizability of crystal structures is pivotal for advancing the practical application of theoretical material structures designed by machine learning or high-throughput screening. However, a significant gap exists between the actual synthesizability and thermodynamic or kinetic stability, which is commonly used for screening theoretical structures for experiments. To address this, we develop the Crystal Synthesis Large Language Models (CSLLM) framework, which includes three LLMs for predicting the synthesizability, synthesis methods, and precursors. We create a comprehensive synthesizability dataset including 140,120 crystal structures and develop an efficient text representation method for crystal structures to fine-tune the LLMs. The Synthesizability LLM achieves a remarkable 98.6% accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional synthesizability screening based on thermodynamic and kinetic stability by 106.1% and 44.5%, respectively. The Methods LLM achieves a classification accuracy of 91.02%, and the Precursors LLM has an 80.2% success rate in predicting synthesis precursors. Furthermore, we develop a user-friendly graphical interface that enables automatic predictions of synthesizability and precursors from uploaded crystal structure files. Through these contributions, CSLLM bridges the gap between theoretical material design and experimental synthesis, paving the way for the rapid discovery of novel and synthesizable functional materials.
