> Synergizing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Review and Future Prospects

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型 (LLM) 虽语言能力强大，但存在事实不一致和透明度问题。知识图谱 (KG) 则以其可验证的知识和符号推理能力，弥补了 LLM 的不足。本文深入剖析了 KG 与 LLM 融合的最新进展，提出一个统一框架，旨在整合现有知识并开拓实际应用新路径，从而提升学术研究的实际影响力。

> Recent advancements have witnessed the ascension of Large Language Models (LLMs), endowed with prodigious linguistic capabilities, albeit marred by shortcomings including factual inconsistencies and opacity. Conversely, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) harbor verifiable knowledge and symbolic reasoning prowess, thereby complementing LLMs' deficiencies. Against this backdrop, the synergy between KGs and LLMs emerges as a pivotal research direction. Our contribution in this paper is a comprehensive dissection of the latest developments in integrating KGs with LLMs. Through meticulous analysis of their confluence points and methodologies, we introduce a unifying framework designed to elucidate and stimulate further exploration among scholars engaged in cognate disciplines. This framework serves a dual purpose: it consolidates extant knowledge while simultaneously delineating novel avenues for real-world deployment, thereby amplifying the translational impact of academic research.
