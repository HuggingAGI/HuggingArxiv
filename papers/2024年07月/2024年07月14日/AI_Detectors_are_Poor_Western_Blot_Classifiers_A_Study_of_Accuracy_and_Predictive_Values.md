> AI Detectors are Poor Western Blot Classifiers: A Study of Accuracy and Predictive Values

# 摘要

> 生成式人工智能（GenAI）的兴起为学术诚信带来了新挑战。本研究测试了三种免费网络AI检测器在识别AI生成的Western blot图像上的效果。结果显示，这些检测器的敏感性和特异性差异显著，且阳性预测值普遍较低。减少Western blot的条带数虽调整了敏感性和特异性，但并未大幅提升整体准确性。这表明，当前的免费AI检测器不足以有效识别伪造的科学图像，迫切需要更专业的工具来应对这一挑战。

> The recent rise of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) capable of creating scientific images presents a challenge in the fight against academic fraud. This study evaluates the efficacy of three free web-based AI detectors in identifying AI-generated images of Western blots, which is a very common technique in biology. We tested these detectors on a collection of artificial Western blot images (n=48) that were created using ChatGPT 4 DALLE 3 and on authentic Western blots (n=48) that were sampled from articles published within four biology journals in 2015; this was before the rise of generative AI based on large language models. The results reveal that the sensitivity (0.9583 for Is It AI, 0.1875 for Hive Moderation, and 0.7083 for Illuminarty) and specificity (0.5417 for Is It AI, 0.8750 for Hive Moderation, and 0.4167 for Illuminarty) are very different. Positive predictive values (PPV) across various AI prevalence were low, for example reaching 0.1885 for Is It AI, 0.1429 for Hive Moderation, and 0.1189 for Illuminarty at an AI prevalence of 0.1. This highlights the difficulty in confidently determining image authenticity based on the output of a single detector. Reducing the size of Western blots from four to two lanes reduced test sensitivities and increased test specificities but did not markedly affect overall detector accuracies and also only slightly improved the PPV of one detector (Is It AI). These findings strongly argue against the use of free AI detectors to detect fake scientific images, and they demonstrate the urgent need for more robust detection tools that are specifically trained on scientific content such as Western blot images.
