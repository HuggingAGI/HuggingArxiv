> Bistability in spatiotemporal mode-locking with dynamic multimode gain

# 摘要

> 三维耗散孤子在时空模式锁定的多模光纤激光器中展现出产生高能量飞秒脉冲的潜力，但其复杂的时空动态仍待深入理解。通过完全建模STML激光器，我们有望揭示其底层物理机制，从而精准调控飞秒脉冲的生成。为此，我们理论探究了基于广义多模非线性薛定谔方程的多模速率方程，构建了动态多模增益模型。利用此模型，我们重新审视了吸引子解剖理论，以洞察3D耗散孤子模态组成的主导因素。实验中，通过调整多模增益光纤的数值孔径，我们观察到不同的增益动态，进而识别出两种STML操作机制：多模增益效应与时空饱和吸收。特别地，在后一机制中，3D耗散孤子展现出双稳态特性，存在两种线性偏振模式的解。实验证实了STML状态可在不同线性偏振模式间切换，并首次验证了由多模增益效应主导的3D孤子成形机制。

> Three-dimensional (3D) dissipative soliton existed in spatiotemporal mode-locked (STML) multimode fiber laser has been demonstrated to be a promising formalism for generating high-energy femtosecond pulses, which unfortunately exhibit diverse spatiotemporal dynamics that have not been fully understood. Completely modeling the STML multimode fiber lasers can shed new light on the underlying physics of the spatiotemporal dynamics and thus better manipulate the generation of high-quality energic femtosecond pulses, which however is still largely unmet. To this end, here we theoretically investigate a dynamic multimode gain model of the STML multimode fiber laser by exploring the multimode rate equation (MMRE) in the framework of generalized multimode nonlinear Schrödinger equation. Using this dynamic multimode gain model, the attractor dissection theory is revisited to understand the dominant effects that determine the modal composition of 3D dissipative soliton. Specifically, by varying the numerical aperture of the multimode gain fiber (MMGF), different gain dynamics that correspond to distinct types of gain attractors are observed. As a result, two distinguishing STML operation regimes, respectively governed by the multimode gain effect and spatiotemporal saturable absorption, are identified. In the latter regime, especially, 3D dissipative solitons present bistability that there exist bifurcated solutions with two different linearly polarized (LP) mode compositions. To verify the theoretical findings, the experimental implementation shows that the state of STML can be switched between different LP modes, and confirms the presence of bistability. Particularly, the 3D-soliton shaping mechanism that is governed by the multimode gain effect is testified for the first time, to the best of our knowledge.
