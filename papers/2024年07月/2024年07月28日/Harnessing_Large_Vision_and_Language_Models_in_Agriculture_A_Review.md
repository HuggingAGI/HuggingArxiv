> Harnessing Large Vision and Language Models in Agriculture: A Review

# 摘要

> 大型模型在多个领域发挥着重要作用，其中农业尤为关键，它为人类提供必需品。然而，农业面临诸多挑战，如害虫、土壤退化等，提高产量成为难题。大型模型通过识别害虫、评估土壤等任务，助力农民提升效率。此外，通过图像、文本等信息，帮助农民决策。我们探讨了大型模型在农业的应用，从LLM到LVLM，再到MLLM，展示了其在农业图像处理、问答系统等方面的潜力。当前，大型模型在农业的应用已初见成效，我们强调其在农业领域的重要性。展望未来，农民将利用MLLM完成更多农业任务，显著提升生产效率和产量。

> Large models can play important roles in many domains. Agriculture is another key factor affecting the lives of people around the world. It provides food, fabric, and coal for humanity. However, facing many challenges such as pests and diseases, soil degradation, global warming, and food security, how to steadily increase the yield in the agricultural sector is a problem that humans still need to solve. Large models can help farmers improve production efficiency and harvest by detecting a series of agricultural production tasks such as pests and diseases, soil quality, and seed quality. It can also help farmers make wise decisions through a variety of information, such as images, text, etc. Herein, we delve into the potential applications of large models in agriculture, from large language model (LLM) and large vision model (LVM) to large vision-language models (LVLM). After gaining a deeper understanding of multimodal large language models (MLLM), it can be recognized that problems such as agricultural image processing, agricultural question answering systems, and agricultural machine automation can all be solved by large models. Large models have great potential in the field of agriculture. We outline the current applications of agricultural large models, and aims to emphasize the importance of large models in the domain of agriculture. In the end, we envisage a future in which famers use MLLM to accomplish many tasks in agriculture, which can greatly improve agricultural production efficiency and yield.
