> Prometheus Chatbot: Knowledge Graph Collaborative Large Language Model for Computer Components Recommendation

# 摘要

> 知识图谱在网络对齐、问答和推荐系统中扮演关键角色，因其能提供结构化数据，助力推断间接关系。然而，开发能处理自然语言输入的基于知识图谱的推荐系统面临两大挑战：一是需有效解析语言歧义，准确把握用户意图；二是需精准匹配实体与知识图谱节点。为此，联想支持下，我们创新研发了“普罗米修斯”聊天机器人，它融合知识图谱与大型语言模型，专为计算机组件推荐设计。该机器人能精准解读用户需求，从知识图谱中提炼个性化推荐，确保对用户计算机配置需求的精准把握与响应。

> Knowledge graphs (KGs) are essential in applications such as network alignment, question-answering, and recommender systems (RSs) since they offer structured relational data that facilitate the inference of indirect relationships. However, the development of KG-based RSs capable of processing user inputs in natural language faces significant challenges. Firstly, natural language processing units must effectively handle the ambiguity and variability in human language to interpret user intents accurately. Secondly, the system must precisely identify and link entities, like product names, to their corresponding nodes in KGs. To overcome these challenges, supported by Lenovo, we developed a novel chatbot called "Prometheus," which integrates a KG with a large language model (LLM), specifically designed for recommending computer components. This chatbot can accurately decode user requests and deliver personalized recommendations derived from KGs, ensuring precise comprehension and response to their computer setup needs.
