> 摘要：多模态人工智能系统很可能在我们的日常生活中无处不在。使这些系统更具交互性的一个有前途的方法是将它们体现为物理和虚拟环境中的代理。目前，系统利用现有的基础模型作为创建具身代理的基本构建块。将代理嵌入这样的环境有助于模型处理和解释视觉和上下文数据的能力，这对于创建更复杂和上下文感知的人工智能系统至关重要。例如，一个能够感知用户动作、人类行为、环境对象、音频表达和场景的集体情绪的系统可以用于为给定环境中的代理响应提供信息和指导。为了加速基于代理的多模态智能的研究，我们将“代理人工智能”定义为一类能够感知视觉刺激、语言输入和其他基于环境的数据，并能产生有意义的具身动作的交互式系统。特别是，我们探索旨在通过结合外部知识、多感官输入和人类反馈来改进基于下一个具身动作预测的代理的系统。我们认为，通过在基于环境的环境中开发代理人工智能系统，还可以减轻大型基础模型的幻觉及其产生环境不正确输出的倾向。新兴的代理人工智能领域包含了多模态交互的更广泛的具身和代理方面。除了在物理世界中行动和交互的代理之外，我们设想未来人们可以轻松创建任何虚拟现实或模拟场景，并与虚拟环境中具身的代理进行交互。

Abstract:Multi-modal AI systems will likely become a ubiquitous presence in our everyday lives. A promising approach to making these systems more interactive is to embody them as agents within physical and virtual environments. At present, systems leverage existing foundation models as the basic building blocks for the creation of embodied agents. Embedding agents within such environments facilitates the ability of models to process and interpret visual and contextual data, which is critical for the creation of more sophisticated and context-aware AI systems. For example, a system that can perceive user actions, human behavior, environmental objects, audio expressions, and the collective sentiment of a scene can be used to inform and direct agent responses within the given environment. To accelerate research on agent-based multimodal intelligence, we define "Agent AI" as a class of interactive systems that can perceive visual stimuli, language inputs, and other environmentally-grounded data, and can produce meaningful embodied actions. In particular, we explore systems that aim to improve agents based on next-embodied action prediction by incorporating external knowledge, multi-sensory inputs, and human feedback. We argue that by developing agentic AI systems in grounded environments, one can also mitigate the hallucinations of large foundation models and their tendency to generate environmentally incorrect outputs. The emerging field of Agent AI subsumes the broader embodied and agentic aspects of multimodal interactions. Beyond agents acting and interacting in the physical world, we envision a future where people can easily create any virtual reality or simulated scene and interact with agents embodied within the virtual environment.
