> Acceleron: A Tool to Accelerate Research Ideation

> 近期出现的多种工具助力研究者应对科研周期各阶段难题，但大多聚焦文献检索、文稿评审与写作等方面。我们的研究揭示，在研究前期至关重要的构思阶段，缺乏针对性强的辅助工具。有鉴于此，我们创新提出“Acceleron”——一款贯穿科研全周期、专为启发研究构思而设计的研究加速器。“Acceleron”引领研究者系统构建包含新颖研究问题的全面提案，并通过对现有文献查漏补缺及建议一套可能的技术解决方案，确保提案创新性得到验证。我们巧妙运用大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力和专业领域知识，打造了一个融入同事与导师角色的代理架构。这一LLM代理仿照研究者实际的构思过程，以互动方式引导研究者共同完善研究提案。尤为值得一提的是，本工具有效应对了LLMs存在的诸如幻觉等问题，采用双阶段面向方面的检索机制平衡精度与召回率之间的矛盾，并妥善处理不可答问题。在评估过程中，我们展示了“Acceleron”在来自3位独立研究者提供的ML与NLP领域的提案上执行动机验证与方法合成工作流程的实际应用。研究人员的反馈和评价证实，此工具能适时地为研究者在各阶段提供有益指引，从而显著提升其工作效率。

> Several tools have recently been proposed for assisting researchers during various stages of the research life-cycle. However, these primarily concentrate on tasks such as retrieving and recommending relevant literature, reviewing and critiquing the draft, and writing of research manuscripts. Our investigation reveals a significant gap in availability of tools specifically designed to assist researchers during the challenging ideation phase of the research life-cycle. To aid with research ideation, we propose `Acceleron', a research accelerator for different phases of the research life cycle, and which is specially designed to aid the ideation process. Acceleron guides researchers through the formulation of a comprehensive research proposal, encompassing a novel research problem. The proposals motivation is validated for novelty by identifying gaps in the existing literature and suggesting a plausible list of techniques to solve the proposed problem. We leverage the reasoning and domain-specific skills of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create an agent-based architecture incorporating colleague and mentor personas for LLMs. The LLM agents emulate the ideation process undertaken by researchers, engaging researchers in an interactive fashion to aid in the development of the research proposal. Notably, our tool addresses challenges inherent in LLMs, such as hallucinations, implements a two-stage aspect-based retrieval to manage precision-recall trade-offs, and tackles issues of unanswerability. As evaluation, we illustrate the execution of our motivation validation and method synthesis workflows on proposals from the ML and NLP domain, given by 3 distinct researchers. Our observations and evaluations provided by the researchers illustrate the efficacy of the tool in terms of assisting researchers with appropriate inputs at distinct stages and thus leading to improved time efficiency.
