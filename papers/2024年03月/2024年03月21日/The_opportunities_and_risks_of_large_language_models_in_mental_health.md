> 面对全球心理健康问题日益严峻的现状以及现有心理健康服务难以满足需求的现实，新兴的大型语言模型（LLMs）因其有望创新并大规模解决心理健康问题而备受期待。尽管尚处初期阶段，LLMs已涉足心理健康相关任务的应用。本文回顾了LLMs在心理健康教育、评估及干预等方面的已有研究成果，并在各领域提炼出其积极影响的关键点。同时，我们也警示了LLMs在心理健康应用中的潜在风险，并倡导采取措施降低这些风险。在急切需要心理健康支持的同时，我们必须谨慎对待心理健康LLMs的研发、测试与部署，特别是要确保它们针对心理健康进行优化调整，促进心理健康公平，遵循伦理规范，并让包括有心理健康经历者在内的各方群体全程参与到从研发至落地的各个环节。重视并优先推进上述工作，有助于最大程度减少对心理健康的潜在损害，从而提高LLMs在全球范围内改善心理健康的几率。

> Global rates of mental health concerns are rising and there is increasing realization that existing models of mental healthcare will not adequately expand to meet the demand. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has come great optimism regarding their promise to create novel, large-scale solutions to support mental health. Despite their nascence, LLMs have already been applied to mental health-related tasks. In this review, we summarize the extant literature on efforts to use LLMs to provide mental health education, assessment, and intervention and highlight key opportunities for positive impact in each area. We then highlight risks associated with LLMs application to mental health and encourage adoption of strategies to mitigate these risks. The urgent need for mental health support must be balanced with responsible development, testing, and deployment of mental health LLMs. Especially critical is ensuring that mental health LLMs are fine-tuned for mental health, enhance mental health equity, adhere to ethical standards, and that people, including those with lived experience with mental health concerns, are involved in all stages from development through deployment. Prioritizing these efforts will minimize potential harms to mental health and maximize the likelihood that LLMs will positively impact mental health globally.
