> Untangling Knots: Leveraging LLM for Error Resolution in Computational Notebooks

# 摘要

> 计算型笔记本因其交互性和灵活性，已成为科研开发中的关键工具。但这种优势牺牲了代码的可复现性，并可能增加出错的风险。尽管市面上有众多针对传统线性代码的错误修复工具，它们在应对新兴的、能够处理复杂语言的大型语言模型时显得力不从心。本文提出了一种创新的解决方案，利用基于LLM的迭代代理来修正计算型笔记本中的错误。我们探讨了这种方法引发的一系列问题，并提供了一个包含缺陷的计算型笔记本数据集，以推动相关研究的发展。

> Computational notebooks became indispensable tools for research-related development, offering unprecedented interactivity and flexibility in the development process. However, these benefits come at the cost of reproducibility and an increased potential for bugs. There are many tools for bug fixing; however, they are generally targeted at the classical linear code. With the rise of code-fluent Large Language Models, a new stream of smart bug-fixing tools has emerged. However, the applicability of those tools is still problematic for non-linear computational notebooks. In this paper, we propose a potential solution for resolving errors in computational notebooks via an iterative LLM-based agent. We discuss the questions raised by this approach and share a novel dataset of computational notebooks containing bugs to facilitate the research of the proposed approach.
