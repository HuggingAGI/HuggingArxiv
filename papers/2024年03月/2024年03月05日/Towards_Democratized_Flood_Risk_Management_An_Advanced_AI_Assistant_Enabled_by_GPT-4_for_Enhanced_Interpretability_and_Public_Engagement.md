> Towards Democratized Flood Risk Management: An Advanced AI Assistant Enabled by GPT-4 for Enhanced Interpretability and Public Engagement

> 实时洪水预测对于实现紧急应对至关重要，但如何弥合复杂模型与实际决策间的差距仍是一大难题。决策者依靠专家解析模型优化防洪策略，而公众理解洪水风险时则受制于复杂的社会文化和制度因素。为此，我们的研究提出了一项革新方案——搭载GPT-4大型语言模型的个性化AI助手。该助手无需专业背景知识，就能助力决策者、公众和预报员高效沟通。它运用GPT-4强大的自然语言理解和功能调用技术，即时发布洪水预警并回应各类洪水相关问题。我们开发的原型系统集成了实时洪水警报、洪水地图及社会脆弱性数据，能将洪水危险区域信息转化成实用的风险管理建议。通过三项主类别的六项指标，我们评估了该原型系统的性能表现。此项研究标志着我们在构建易于使用且亲民的洪水风险管理方法上取得了重大突破，并强调了GPT-4等尖端AI工具在推动信息公开透明及提升公众在重大社会环境问题上的参与度方面的巨大潜力。

> Real-time flood forecasting plays a crucial role in enabling timely and effective emergency responses. However, a significant challenge lies in bridging the gap between complex numerical flood models and practical decision-making. Decision-makers often rely on experts to interpret these models for optimizing flood mitigation strategies. And the public requires complex techniques to inquiry and understand socio-cultural and institutional factors, often hinders the public's understanding of flood risks. To overcome these challenges, our study introduces an innovative solution: a customized AI Assistant powered by the GPT-4 Large Language Model. This AI Assistant is designed to facilitate effective communication between decision-makers, the general public, and flood forecasters, without the requirement of specialized knowledge. The new framework utilizes GPT-4's advanced natural language understanding and function calling capabilities to provide immediate flood alerts and respond to various flood-related inquiries. Our developed prototype integrates real-time flood warnings with flood maps and social vulnerability data. It also effectively translates complex flood zone information into actionable risk management advice. To assess its performance, we evaluated the prototype using six criteria within three main categories: relevance, error resilience, and understanding of context. Our research marks a significant step towards a more accessible and user-friendly approach in flood risk management. This study highlights the potential of advanced AI tools like GPT-4 in democratizing information and enhancing public engagement in critical social and environmental issues.
