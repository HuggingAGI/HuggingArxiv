> Reading Users' Minds from What They Say: An Investigation into LLM-based Empathic Mental Inference

> 以人为本的设计实践中，深入理解用户感受、具备共情能力是打造真正满足人性需求产品的关键所在。然而，当今要精准把握大规模人群的真实内心世界仍是一大挑战，其根源在于用户体验研究的深度与广度之间难以兼得：小范围内的深刻洞察往往难以推广至大众，反之亦然。本论文研究了运用大型语言模型（LLMs）来执行心理推理任务，特别关注推测用户深层次目标及基本心理需求（FPNs）。我们从实际用户和设计师处收集基准数据，构建了一套评估LLMs心理推理能力的共情精确度标准。实验中，我们将采用不同零样本提示技术的各类LLMs与人类设计师在推测目标和FPNs上的共情精确度进行了对比。实验结果显示，LLMs在推测用户内在目标和FPNs方面展现出了与人类设计师相媲美的理解力，预示着通过融合高级人工智能技术，有望拓宽共情设计方法的规模化应用路径。此项研究将有力拓展设计师在以人为本设计过程中的工具集，推动实现对用户体验的大规模而细致入微的理解。

> In human-centered design, developing a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of user experiences, i.e., empathic understanding, is paramount for designing products that truly meet human needs. Nevertheless, accurately comprehending the real underlying mental states of a large human population remains a significant challenge today. This difficulty mainly arises from the trade-off between depth and scale of user experience research: gaining in-depth insights from a small group of users does not easily scale to a larger population, and vice versa. This paper investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for performing mental inference tasks, specifically inferring users' underlying goals and fundamental psychological needs (FPNs). Baseline and benchmark datasets were collected from human users and designers to develop an empathic accuracy metric for measuring the mental inference performance of LLMs. The empathic accuracy of inferring goals and FPNs of different LLMs with varied zero-shot prompt engineering techniques are experimented against that of human designers. Experimental results suggest that LLMs can infer and understand the underlying goals and FPNs of users with performance comparable to that of human designers, suggesting a promising avenue for enhancing the scalability of empathic design approaches through the integration of advanced artificial intelligence technologies. This work has the potential to significantly augment the toolkit available to designers during human-centered design, enabling the development of both large-scale and in-depth understanding of users' experiences.
