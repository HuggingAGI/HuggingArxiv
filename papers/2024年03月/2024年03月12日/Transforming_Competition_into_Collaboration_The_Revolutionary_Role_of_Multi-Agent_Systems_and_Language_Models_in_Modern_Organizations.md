> 本文探讨了运用多智能体系统理论（SMA）构建的计算实体，结合大型语言模型（LLM）的强大模拟人际互动能力，如何变革人机交互——从依赖专有人工智能代理支持运营流程到战略决策制定。然而，以往研究表明，在面对逻辑推理、问题解决等新型实践任务时，特别是人工代理的自主性方面存在局限。此外，传统的思考链刺激等技术需借助人工明确指导。为此，我们采用基于LLM的不同行为原型的智能体，并借助场景化商业案例（角色扮演）驱动知识生成的策略，通过智能体间的引导式对话交流来展现潜力。我们的方法旨在基于SMA理论与LLM创新应用研发有助于组织战略实施的智能体，提供一种针对多元应用场景、复杂程度、领域以及LLM功能差异化的灵活实验方案。

> This article explores the dynamic influence of computational entities based on multi-agent systems theory (SMA) combined with large language models (LLM), which are characterized by their ability to simulate complex human interactions, as a possibility to revolutionize human user interaction from the use of specialized artificial agents to support everything from operational organizational processes to strategic decision making based on applied knowledge and human orchestration. Previous investigations reveal that there are limitations, particularly in the autonomous approach of artificial agents, especially when dealing with new challenges and pragmatic tasks such as inducing logical reasoning and problem solving. It is also considered that traditional techniques, such as the stimulation of chains of thoughts, require explicit human guidance. In our approach we employ agents developed from large language models (LLM), each with distinct prototyping that considers behavioral elements, driven by strategies that stimulate the generation of knowledge based on the use case proposed in the scenario (role-play) business, using a discussion approach between agents (guided conversation). We demonstrate the potential of developing agents useful for organizational strategies, based on multi-agent system theories (SMA) and innovative uses based on large language models (LLM based), offering a differentiated and adaptable experiment to different applications, complexities, domains, and capabilities from LLM.
