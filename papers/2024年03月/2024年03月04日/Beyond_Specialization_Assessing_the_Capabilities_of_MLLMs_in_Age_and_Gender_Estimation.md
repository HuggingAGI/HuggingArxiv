> Beyond Specialization: Assessing the Capabilities of MLLMs in Age and Gender Estimation

发布时间：2024年03月04日

> 近期大热的多模态大型语言模型（MLLM），例如ChatGPT-4V、Gemini及开源模型LLaVA等，凭借其普适性和强大多样任务处理能力，甚至可在未受过专门训练的任务（如计算机视觉任务）中展现出卓越性能。我们拿当今最强悍的几个MLLM——ShareGPT4V、ChatGPT、LLaVA-Next，与我们最先进的专项模型MiVOLO，在一项年龄和性别的精细化估计任务中进行了一场较量，并对MiVOLO做了进一步优化升级，文中还呈现了详尽细节和全新评测指标。这场对比试验揭示了各模型的优势与不足之处，饶有趣味。另外，我们针对这项特定任务对ShareGPT4V模型尝试了多种微调策略，力求在该领域取得突破性的成果。尽管在实际应用中，鉴于成本高昂相较于MiVOLO这类专项模型，此类模型不太适合投入生产环境，但在一些场景如数据标注工作中，它的价值不容忽视。

> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently gained immense popularity. Powerful commercial models like ChatGPT-4V and Gemini, as well as open-source ones such as LLaVA, are essentially general-purpose models and are applied to solve a wide variety of tasks, including those in computer vision. These neural networks possess such strong general knowledge and reasoning abilities that they have proven capable of working even on tasks for which they were not specifically trained. We compared the capabilities of the most powerful MLLMs to date: ShareGPT4V, ChatGPT, LLaVA-Next in a specialized task of age and gender estimation with our state-of-the-art specialized model, MiVOLO. We also updated MiVOLO and provide details and new metrics in this article. This comparison has yielded some interesting results and insights about the strengths and weaknesses of the participating models. Furthermore, we attempted various ways to fine-tune the ShareGPT4V model for this specific task, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art results in this particular challenge. Although such a model would not be practical in production, as it is incredibly expensive compared to a specialized model like MiVOLO, it could be very useful in some tasks, like data annotation.
