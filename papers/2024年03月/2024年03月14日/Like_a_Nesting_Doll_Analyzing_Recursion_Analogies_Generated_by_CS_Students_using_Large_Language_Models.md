> "Like a Nesting Doll": Analyzing Recursion Analogies Generated by CS Students using Large Language Models

> 面对复杂的计算概念，学生往往难以将其与已知的经验联系起来，而生动的类比则能搭建起陌生与熟悉间的桥梁，激发兴趣、助力理解。尽管如此，创造高质量的教学类比连资深教师也觉得不易。本研究探讨了大型语言模型（特别是ChatGPT）能否根据需求提供个性化的类比。我们聚焦于颇具挑战性的“递归”这一阈值概念，对350多名一年级计算机专业学生生成的类比进行了深入探究。实验中，学生们获得一段代码片段，并借助ChatGPT自主创作与递归相关的类比，鼓励他们在提示中融入个人感兴趣的主题。结果显示，学生们所创设主题的类比展现出丰富多样，与一般通用类比相比，更凸显了与LLMs互动过程中学生创新精神的重要性。此活动不仅深受学生喜爱，使他们对递归的理解得以深化，而且他们普遍反映，那些与个人经历及文化紧密相关的类比更加易于记忆。

> Grasping complex computing concepts often poses a challenge for students who struggle to anchor these new ideas to familiar experiences and understandings. To help with this, a good analogy can bridge the gap between unfamiliar concepts and familiar ones, providing an engaging way to aid understanding. However, creating effective educational analogies is difficult even for experienced instructors. We investigate to what extent large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, can provide access to personally relevant analogies on demand. Focusing on recursion, a challenging threshold concept, we conducted an investigation analyzing the analogies generated by more than 350 first-year computing students. They were provided with a code snippet and tasked to generate their own recursion-based analogies using ChatGPT, optionally including personally relevant topics in their prompts. We observed a great deal of diversity in the analogies produced with student-prescribed topics, in contrast to the otherwise generic analogies, highlighting the value of student creativity when working with LLMs. Not only did students enjoy the activity and report an improved understanding of recursion, but they described more easily remembering analogies that were personally and culturally relevant.
