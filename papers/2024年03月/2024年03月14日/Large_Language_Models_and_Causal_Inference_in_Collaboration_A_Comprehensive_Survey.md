> Large Language Models and Causal Inference in Collaboration: A Comprehensive Survey

> 因果推断揭示了通过捕捉变量间因果联系，能够有效提升NLP模型的各项性能，包括预测精度、公平性、鲁棒性及可解释性。随着生成型大型语言模型（LLMs）崭露头角，凭借其卓越的推理功能，在众多NLP领域产生深远影响。本次调研聚焦于从因果分析的角度评估和优化LLMs，具体围绕四个方面展开：深入理解与强化LLMs的推理机能，应对LLMs中公平性与安全性挑战，借助解释补足LLMs功能，并处理多模态数据。此外，LLMs强大的推理能力也能反哺因果推断领域，助力因果关系挖掘与因果效应估算。本文综合审视了因果推断框架与LLMs两者间的互动作用，突出强调二者携手共进，对于构建更为先进且公正的人工智能系统的巨大潜力。

> Causal inference has shown potential in enhancing the predictive accuracy, fairness, robustness, and explainability of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models by capturing causal relationships among variables. The emergence of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly impacted various NLP domains, particularly through their advanced reasoning capabilities. This survey focuses on evaluating and improving LLMs from a causal view in the following areas: understanding and improving the LLMs' reasoning capacity, addressing fairness and safety issues in LLMs, complementing LLMs with explanations, and handling multimodality. Meanwhile, LLMs' strong reasoning capacities can in turn contribute to the field of causal inference by aiding causal relationship discovery and causal effect estimations. This review explores the interplay between causal inference frameworks and LLMs from both perspectives, emphasizing their collective potential to further the development of more advanced and equitable artificial intelligence systems.
