# 摘要

> 本文深入探讨了融合多代理系统理论（SMA）与大型语言模型（LLM）的计算实体的动态影响力，这些模型以其模拟复杂人际互动的能力而闻名，为人类用户交互方式带来了革命性的变化，从依赖特定人工智能代理到全方位支持组织运营流程和基于应用知识与人类协同的战略决策。先前的研究指出，特别是在自主人工智能代理的方法上存在局限，尤其是在面对新挑战和实用任务，如逻辑推理和问题解决时。此外，传统技术如思维链的刺激需要明确的人类引导。我们的方法采用了基于LLM开发的代理，每个代理都具有独特的原型，考虑了行为元素，并由策略驱动，这些策略旨在激发基于场景（角色扮演）业务用例的知识生成，通过代理间的讨论（引导对话）进行。我们展示了利用基于SMA的多代理系统理论和基于LLM的创新应用，开发出适用于组织战略的代理的潜力，为不同应用、复杂性、领域和LLM能力提供了差异化和适应性的实验。

> This article explores the dynamic influence of computational entities based on multi-agent systems theory (SMA) combined with large language models (LLM), which are characterized by their ability to simulate complex human interactions, as a possibility to revolutionize human user interaction from the use of specialized artificial agents to support everything from operational organizational processes to strategic decision making based on applied knowledge and human orchestration. Previous investigations reveal that there are limitations, particularly in the autonomous approach of artificial agents, especially when dealing with new challenges and pragmatic tasks such as inducing logical reasoning and problem solving. It is also considered that traditional techniques, such as the stimulation of chains of thoughts, require explicit human guidance. In our approach we employ agents developed from large language models (LLM), each with distinct prototyping that considers behavioral elements, driven by strategies that stimulate the generation of knowledge based on the use case proposed in the scenario (role-play) business, using a discussion approach between agents (guided conversation). We demonstrate the potential of developing agents useful for organizational strategies, based on multi-agent system theories (SMA) and innovative uses based on large language models (LLM based), offering a differentiated and adaptable experiment to different applications, complexities, domains, and capabilities from LLM.
