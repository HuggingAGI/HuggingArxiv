> 尖端的语言处理和机器学习技术有望彻底革新过去大量依赖人力的专利和技术知识管理领域，大幅提升工作效率。面对海量且复杂的专利数据，其内容表述精准独特，极具挑战性。专利文本不同于一般文本的特点，孕育着无限机遇和难题。本文系统梳理了专利相关任务及热门研究方法，重点关注快速演进且充满潜力的技术路径。语言处理技术中的大型语言模型，以及近年来兴起的通用生成方法，正蓄势待发，有望在专利领域掀起一场革命。专利文献及其基于事实的严密论证过程堪称此类技术的理想应用场景。然而，专利文本特有的难点令现有模型在处理时捉襟见肘。本文揭示了影响专利技术和数据管理的核心专利特征，并对现有方法进行了深入探讨，同时强调了建立可靠且公正评估标准的重要性。虽然在某些任务上研究已取得重大突破，但针对许多其他任务的表现仍有不足，原因或是专利语言本身的特殊性，或是法律术语与日常用语含义间的差异。另外，当前能有效生成专利特定部分高质量文本的方法仍较为稀缺。通过剖析关键进展、机遇与空白，我们期望激发更多研究热情，助推这一领域的发展进程。

> Advanced language-processing and machine-learning techniques promise massive efficiency improvements in the previously widely manual field of patent and technical knowledge management. This field presents large-scale and complex data with very precise contents and language representation of those contents. Particularly, patent texts can differ from mundane texts in various aspects, which entails significant opportunities and challenges. This paper presents a systematic overview of patent-related tasks and popular methodologies with a special focus on evolving and promising techniques. Language processing and particularly large language models as well as the recent boost of general generative methods promise to become game changers in the patent field. The patent literature and the fact-based argumentative procedures around patents appear almost as an ideal use case. However, patents entail a number of difficulties with which existing models struggle. The paper introduces fundamental aspects of patents and patent-related data that affect technology that wants to explore or manage them. It further reviews existing methods and approaches and points out how important reliable and unbiased evaluation metrics become. Although research has made substantial progress on certain tasks, the performance across many others remains suboptimal, sometimes because of either the special nature of patents and their language or inconsistencies between legal terms and the everyday meaning of terms. Moreover, yet few methods have demonstrated the ability to produce satisfactory text for specific sections of patents. By pointing out key developments, opportunities, and gaps, we aim to encourage further research and accelerate the advancement of this field.
