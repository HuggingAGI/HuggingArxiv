> AutoAttacker: A Large Language Model Guided System to Implement Automatic Cyber-attacks

> LLMs在处理自然语言任务时表现出色，已被安全研究人员广泛应用于攻防系统中。针对网络攻击如钓鱼和恶意软件生成的预入侵阶段，已有多个利用LLMs的研究项目。不过，目前尚未有一份全面的研究探讨LLM-based系统能否模拟涉及多种攻击技术和环境下的、通常需要人工操作（即“键盘实战”）的攻击后阶段。随着LLMs技术的不断进步，未来很可能实现对攻击全程（包括预入侵和后入侵阶段）的自动化。这种变化或将使组织面临的攻击模式由稀缺的专业人士发起的事件，转变为高频次、无需专门技能且按自动化规模实施的行动，从而对全球计算机安全带来根本性挑战，并可能引发巨大的经济冲击。本研究旨在深入剖析这些潜在风险，以便我们提前为未来更加强大的LLMs做好充分准备。当前来看，这项研究具有三大实际意义：一是构建基于LLM的自动化后入侵利用框架，帮助分析人员迅速检验并对抗前所未见的攻击，提升组织网络安全防护能力；二是研发基于LLM的渗透测试系统，增强有限人力资源的红队效能；三是通过这项研究，防御系统和团队得以提前识别并掌握新型攻击行为特征，在其出现在真实环境中前即加以预防。

> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive results on natural language tasks, and security researchers are beginning to employ them in both offensive and defensive systems. In cyber-security, there have been multiple research efforts that utilize LLMs focusing on the pre-breach stage of attacks like phishing and malware generation. However, so far there lacks a comprehensive study regarding whether LLM-based systems can be leveraged to simulate the post-breach stage of attacks that are typically human-operated, or "hands-on-keyboard" attacks, under various attack techniques and environments.
  As LLMs inevitably advance, they may be able to automate both the pre- and post-breach attack stages. This shift may transform organizational attacks from rare, expert-led events to frequent, automated operations requiring no expertise and executed at automation speed and scale. This risks fundamentally changing global computer security and correspondingly causing substantial economic impacts, and a goal of this work is to better understand these risks now so we can better prepare for these inevitable ever-more-capable LLMs on the horizon. On the immediate impact side, this research serves three purposes. First, an automated LLM-based, post-breach exploitation framework can help analysts quickly test and continually improve their organization's network security posture against previously unseen attacks. Second, an LLM-based penetration test system can extend the effectiveness of red teams with a limited number of human analysts. Finally, this research can help defensive systems and teams learn to detect novel attack behaviors preemptively before their use in the wild....
