> Steady-State Initialization of Object-Oriented Advanced Thermal Power Generation System Models with Application to the Case of the SOS-CO2 Cycle

# 摘要

> 即将到来的能源转型呼唤新一代低排放或零排放、运行高度灵活的火力发电系统。动态建模与模拟在这一领域是关键的促成因素，因为控制这类电厂是个难题，此前毫无经验，且预期设计时间极短。这些动态模型的稳态初始化是设计流程中的重要一环，然而这是个棘手的任务，涉及用迭代牛顿法求解大型非线性方程组，常常容易出现数值错误。
在本项工作中，探讨了若干策略和方法，以成功达成先进火力发电系统基于第一原理方程、面向对象模型的稳态初始化。这些是在 Modelica 建模语言的情境下提出的，但也能应用于其他基于方程、面向对象的建模与模拟环境。
最后，展示了这些策略和方法在 SOS-CO2 先进发电系统中的成功运用。

> The forthcoming energy transition calls for a new generation of thermal power generation systems with low- or zero-emission and highly flexible operation. Dynamic modelling and simulation is a key enabling factor in this field, as controlling such plants is a difficult task for which there is no previous experience and very short design times are expected. The steady-state initialization of those dynamic models is an essential step in the design process, but is unfortunately a difficult task which involves the numerical solution of large systems of nonlinear equations with iterative Newton methods, which is often prone to numerical failures.
  In this work, several strategies and methodologies are discussed to successfully achieve steady-state initialization of first-principles equation-based, object-oriented models of advanced thermal power generation systems. These are presented in the context of the Modelica modelling language, but could be applied to other equation-based, object-oriented modelling and simulation environments.
  Finally, the successful application of such strategies and methodologies to the SOS-CO2 advanced power generation system is presented.
