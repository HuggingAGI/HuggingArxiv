> "It was 80% me, 20% AI": Seeking Authenticity in Co-Writing with Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 鉴于人工智能写作辅助工具，尤其是由大型语言模型（LLMs）驱动的那些，日益增多且愈发多样，作家和读者或许都担忧这些工具会对写作作品的真实性产生影响。我们探究了作家在与人工智能工具合写时，是否以及怎样想要留存自己真实的声音，还有人工智能写作支持的个性化能否助力达成此目标。我们对 19 位专业作家展开了半结构化访谈，期间他们分别使用了个性化和非个性化的人工智能写作支持工具进行合写。我们还通过在线调查收集了 30 位热心读者对于与人工智能共同创作的书面作品的看法，以此补充作家的观点。我们的发现阐明了人类与人工智能共同创作中的真实性概念，其更侧重于构建创作者真实自我的过程和体验。尽管作家对个性化的人工智能写作工具反应积极，但他们觉得个性化的形式得针对作家的成长，不能局限于文本生成阶段。总的来说，读者的回应显示出对人类与人工智能共同写作的担忧较少。读者区分不出人工智能辅助的作品（不管是否个性化）和作家独自创作的作品，并且对作家尝试用于创意写作的新技术持积极态度。

> Given the rising proliferation and diversity of AI writing assistance tools, especially those powered by large language models (LLMs), both writers and readers may have concerns about the impact of these tools on the authenticity of writing work. We examine whether and how writers want to preserve their authentic voice when co-writing with AI tools and whether personalization of AI writing support could help achieve this goal. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 professional writers, during which they co-wrote with both personalized and non-personalized AI writing-support tools. We supplemented writers' perspectives with opinions from 30 avid readers about the written work co-produced with AI collected through an online survey. Our findings illuminate conceptions of authenticity in human-AI co-creation, which focus more on the process and experience of constructing creators' authentic selves. While writers reacted positively to personalized AI writing tools, they believed the form of personalization needs to target writers' growth and go beyond the phase of text production. Overall, readers' responses showed less concern about human-AI co-writing. Readers could not distinguish AI-assisted work, personalized or not, from writers' solo-written work and showed positive attitudes toward writers experimenting with new technology for creative writing.
