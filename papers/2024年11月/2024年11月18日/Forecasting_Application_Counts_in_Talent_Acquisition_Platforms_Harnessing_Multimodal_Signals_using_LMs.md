> Forecasting Application Counts in Talent Acquisition Platforms: Harnessing Multimodal Signals using LMs

# 摘要

> 随着招聘和人才招揽的竞争愈发激烈，招聘公司运用机器学习（ML）方法优化日常活动的手段也愈发成熟。然而，此领域已发表的多数基于 ML 的方法仅局限于候选人匹配、工作与技能匹配、工作分类及规范化等任务。在本研究中，我们探讨了招聘领域的一项新任务——申请数量预测，其出发点是设计有效的拓展活动来吸引合格的申请人。我们发现，现有的基于自回归的时间序列预测方法在该任务中表现欠佳。于是，我们提出了一种基于多模态 LM 的模型，它通过一个简单的编码器融合了各种模态的职位发布元数据。来自 CareerBuilder LLC 的大型真实数据集的实验显示，所提方法比现有最先进的方法更有效。

> As recruitment and talent acquisition have become more and more competitive, recruitment firms have become more sophisticated in using machine learning (ML) methodologies for optimizing their day to day activities. But, most of published ML based methodologies in this area have been limited to the tasks like candidate matching, job to skill matching, job classification and normalization. In this work, we discuss a novel task in the recruitment domain, namely, application count forecasting, motivation of which comes from designing of effective outreach activities to attract qualified applicants. We show that existing auto-regressive based time series forecasting methods perform poorly for this task. Henceforth, we propose a multimodal LM-based model which fuses job-posting metadata of various modalities through a simple encoder. Experiments from large real-life datasets from CareerBuilder LLC show the effectiveness of the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art methods.
