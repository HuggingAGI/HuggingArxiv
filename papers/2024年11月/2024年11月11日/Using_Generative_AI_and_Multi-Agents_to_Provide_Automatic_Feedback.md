> 本研究对在教育情境中运用生成式人工智能和多智能体系统来提供自动反馈进行了探究，尤其是针对科学评估中学生构建的回答。研究着眼于如何通过名为AutoFeedback的多智能体系统提升生成式人工智能所生成反馈的质量，填补了该领域的关键空白，克服了单智能体大型语言模型（LLMs）中常见的过度赞扬和过度推断等问题。研究开发了一个由两个人工智能代理构成的多智能体系统：一个负责生成反馈，另一个负责验证和优化。该系统在240个学生回答的数据集上进行了测试，并与单智能体LLM的性能做了对比。结果显示，AutoFeedback显著降低了过度赞扬和过度推断错误的出现，提供了更精准且具有教学价值的反馈。这些发现表明，多智能体系统能够为教育场景中的自动反馈生成提供更可靠的解决方案，突显了其在可扩展和个性化学习支持方面的潜力。这些结果对试图在形成性评估中借助人工智能的教育工作者和研究人员具有重要启示，为更有效的反馈机制开辟了道路，有助于提升学生的学习成果。

> This study investigates the use of generative AI and multi-agent systems to provide automatic feedback in educational contexts, particularly for student constructed responses in science assessments. The research addresses a key gap in the field by exploring how multi-agent systems, called AutoFeedback, can improve the quality of GenAI-generated feedback, overcoming known issues such as over-praise and over-inference that are common in single-agent large language models (LLMs). The study developed a multi-agent system consisting of two AI agents: one for generating feedback and another for validating and refining it. The system was tested on a dataset of 240 student responses, and its performance was compared to that of a single-agent LLM. Results showed that AutoFeedback significantly reduced the occurrence of over-praise and over-inference errors, providing more accurate and pedagogically sound feedback. The findings suggest that multi-agent systems can offer a more reliable solution for generating automated feedback in educational settings, highlighting their potential for scalable and personalized learning support. These results have important implications for educators and researchers seeking to leverage AI in formative assessments, offering a pathway to more effective feedback mechanisms that enhance student learning outcomes.
