# 摘要

> 确保移动应用的可用性至关重要，因为可用性问题会损害用户体验，给应用的感知质量带来负面影响。本文介绍了 UX-LLM，这是一款由大型视觉语言模型驱动的新型工具，能够预测 iOS 应用中的可用性问题。为评估 UX-LLM 的性能，我们在两个中等复杂程度的开源应用中预测了可用性问题，并请可用性专家进行评估。我们还对这两款应用进行了传统的可用性测试和专家审查，并将结果与 UX-LLM 的结果作对比。UX-LLM 的精度在 0.61 至 0.66 之间，召回率在 0.35 至 0.38 之间，这表明它能够识别有效的可用性问题，但未能捕获大部分问题。最后，我们与一个为视障人士开发交通应用的顶点项目的应用开发团队开展了焦点小组讨论。焦点小组对 UX-LLM 表示认可，因为它发现了应用中未知的可用性问题。不过，他们也对其融入开发工作流程表示担忧，并提出了潜在的改进建议。我们的结果表明，UX-LLM 无法完全取代传统的可用性评估方法，但对于资源有限的小团队而言，由于它能够检查源代码，所以是一个很有价值的补充，尤其能在不太常见的用户路径中发现问题。

> Ensuring usability is crucial for the success of mobile apps. Usability issues can compromise user experience and negatively impact the perceived app quality. This paper presents UX-LLM, a novel tool powered by a Large Vision-Language Model that predicts usability issues in iOS apps. To evaluate the performance of UX-LLM we predicted usability issues in two open-source apps of a medium complexity and asked usability experts to assess the predictions. We also performed traditional usability testing and expert review for both apps and compared the results to those of UX-LLM. UX-LLM demonstrated precision ranging from 0.61 and 0.66 and recall between 0.35 and 0.38, indicating its ability to identify valid usability issues, yet failing to capture the majority of issues. Finally, we conducted a focus group with an app development team of a capstone project developing a transit app for visually impaired persons. The focus group expressed positive perceptions of UX-LLM as it identified unknown usability issues in their app. However, they also raised concerns about its integration into the development workflow, suggesting potential improvements. Our results show that UX-LLM cannot fully replace traditional usability evaluation methods but serves as a valuable supplement particularly for small teams with limited resources, to identify issues in less common user paths, due to its ability to inspect the source code.
