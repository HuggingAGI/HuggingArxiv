> Two Heads Are Better Than One: Collaborative LLM Embodied Agents for Human-Robot Interaction

# 摘要

> 随着被称为大型语言模型（LLMs）的自然语言生成模型的最新发展，一个有望改善人类与机器人助手交互方式的潜在用例出现了。这些LLMs理应凭借其广泛的理解能力，把自然语言命令转化为有效、契合任务且安全的机器人任务执行。但现实中，这些模型存在幻觉，可能引发安全问题或偏离任务。在其他领域，借助多个LLM代理能共同工作来集体规划、编码和自我检查输出的协作式AI系统，此类问题已得到改善。在本次研究中，对多个协作式AI系统和单个独立的AI代理进行了测试，以确定其他领域的成功能否转化为更优的人机交互性能。结果显示，代理数量和模型成功之间没有明确的趋势。不过，显然某些协作式AI代理架构在生成无错误代码和解决抽象问题方面的能力有显著提升。

> With the recent development of natural language generation models - termed as large language models (LLMs) - a potential use case has opened up to improve the way that humans interact with robot assistants. These LLMs should be able to leverage their large breadth of understanding to interpret natural language commands into effective, task appropriate and safe robot task executions. However, in reality, these models suffer from hallucinations, which may cause safety issues or deviations from the task. In other domains, these issues have been improved through the use of collaborative AI systems where multiple LLM agents can work together to collectively plan, code and self-check outputs. In this research, multiple collaborative AI systems were tested against a single independent AI agent to determine whether the success in other domains would translate into improved human-robot interaction performance. The results show that there is no defined trend between the number of agents and the success of the model. However, it is clear that some collaborative AI agent architectures can exhibit a greatly improved capacity to produce error-free code and to solve abstract problems.
