# 摘要

> 人工智能（AI）在现代医疗保健领域已不可或缺，大型语言模型（LLMs）为临床决策带来了颇具前景的进步。传统的基于模型的方法，像那些借助上下文演示的以及进行专门医学微调的，在医学语言处理方面表现不俗，然而在实时适应能力、多步推理以及处理复杂医疗任务方面却面临挑战。基于智能体的AI系统通过融入推理痕迹、基于上下文的工具选择、知识检索以及短长期记忆来化解这些局限。这些新增功能让医疗AI智能体能够应对复杂的医疗场景，在此场景中，决策应基于与环境的实时互动。所以，与把医疗查询当作孤立问题的传统基于模型的方法不同，医疗AI智能体将其视作复杂任务，表现更近似人类医生。在本文中，我们探究了医疗AI智能体的核心LLM的选择，这是智能体整体推理和行动生成的基石。特别是，我们考量了新兴的o1模型，并研究了其在不同临床场景（涵盖像重症监护病房（ICUs）这样的高风险环境）中对智能体推理、工具使用适应性以及实时信息检索的影响。我们的发现证明o1能够提升诊断的准确性和一致性，为更智能、更敏锐的AI工具开辟道路，助力在临床实践中达成更优的患者结果和决策效能。

> Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become essential in modern healthcare, with large language models (LLMs) offering promising advances in clinical decision-making. Traditional model-based approaches, including those leveraging in-context demonstrations and those with specialized medical fine-tuning, have demonstrated strong performance in medical language processing but struggle with real-time adaptability, multi-step reasoning, and handling complex medical tasks. Agent-based AI systems address these limitations by incorporating reasoning traces, tool selection based on context, knowledge retrieval, and both short- and long-term memory. These additional features enable the medical AI agent to handle complex medical scenarios where decision-making should be built on real-time interaction with the environment. Therefore, unlike conventional model-based approaches that treat medical queries as isolated questions, medical AI agents approach them as complex tasks and behave more like human doctors. In this paper, we study the choice of the backbone LLM for medical AI agents, which is the foundation for the agent's overall reasoning and action generation. In particular, we consider the emergent o1 model and examine its impact on agents' reasoning, tool-use adaptability, and real-time information retrieval across diverse clinical scenarios, including high-stakes settings such as intensive care units (ICUs). Our findings demonstrate o1's ability to enhance diagnostic accuracy and consistency, paving the way for smarter, more responsive AI tools that support better patient outcomes and decision-making efficacy in clinical practice.
