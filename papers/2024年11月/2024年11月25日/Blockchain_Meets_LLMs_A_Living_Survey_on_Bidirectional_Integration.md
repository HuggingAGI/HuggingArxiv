# 摘要

> 在大型语言模型范畴，多模态大型语言模型及可解释性研究已取得显著进展，这得益于持续的技术进步与创新。不过，安全与隐私问题在该领域依旧是突出挑战。具有去中心化、防篡改、分布式存储及可追溯等特性的区块链技术的出现，为解决这些问题提供了新途径。这两项技术各自具备巨大的发展潜能；然而，它们的结合展现出众多跨学科机遇和增长前景。当下的研究趋向愈发聚焦于区块链与大型语言模型的融合，旨在通过这种融合弥补各自的局限，推动技术进一步演进。在此研究中，我们评估了这两种技术的优势与发展限制，探索了它们结合的可能性与发展潜力。本文主要探究了两个方向的技术融合：其一，大型语言模型于区块链的应用，我们明确了六个主要发展方向，并探讨了区块链技术短板的解决办法及其应用场景；其二，区块链技术在大型语言模型中的应用，借助区块链的特性弥补大型语言模型的不足，探索其在多领域的应用潜力。

> In the domain of large language models, considerable advancements have been attained in multimodal large language models and explainability research, propelled by the continuous technological progress and innovation. Nonetheless, security and privacy concerns continue to pose as prominent challenges in this field. The emergence of blockchain technology, marked by its decentralized nature, tamper-proof attributes, distributed storage functionality, and traceability, has provided novel approaches for resolving these issues. Both of these technologies independently hold vast potential for development; yet, their combination uncovers substantial cross-disciplinary opportunities and growth prospects. The current research tendencies are increasingly concentrating on the integration of blockchain with large language models, with the aim of compensating for their respective limitations through this fusion and promoting further technological evolution. In this study, we evaluate the advantages and developmental constraints of the two technologies, and explore the possibility and development potential of their combination. This paper primarily investigates the technical convergence in two directions: Firstly, the application of large language models to blockchain, where we identify six major development directions and explore solutions to the shortcomings of blockchain technology and their application scenarios; Secondly, the application of blockchain technology to large language models, leveraging the characteristics of blockchain to remedy the deficiencies of large language models and exploring its application potential in multiple fields.
