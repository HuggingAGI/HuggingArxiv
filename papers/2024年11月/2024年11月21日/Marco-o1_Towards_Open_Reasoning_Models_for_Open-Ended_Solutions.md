> Marco-o1: Towards Open Reasoning Models for Open-Ended Solutions

# 摘要

> 当下，OpenAI o1 掀起了对大型推理模型（LRM）研究的热潮。基于此，Marco-o1 不但着眼于像数学、物理和编码这类有标准答案、适合强化学习（RL）的学科，还更注重开放式的解决办法。我们想要解答：“o1 模型能否有效推广到缺乏明确标准且奖励难以量化的更广泛领域？”Marco-o1 借助思维链（CoT）微调、蒙特卡罗树搜索（MCTS）、反射机制以及创新的推理策略，针对复杂的现实世界问题解决任务进行了优化。

> Currently OpenAI o1 has sparked a surge of interest in the study of large reasoning models (LRM). Building on this momentum, Marco-o1 not only focuses on disciplines with standard answers, such as mathematics, physics, and coding -- which are well-suited for reinforcement learning (RL) -- but also places greater emphasis on open-ended resolutions. We aim to address the question: "Can the o1 model effectively generalize to broader domains where clear standards are absent and rewards are challenging to quantify?" Marco-o1 is powered by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), reflection mechanisms, and innovative reasoning strategies -- optimized for complex real-world problem-solving tasks.
