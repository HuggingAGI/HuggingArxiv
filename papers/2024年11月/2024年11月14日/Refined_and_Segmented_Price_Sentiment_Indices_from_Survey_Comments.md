> Refined and Segmented Price Sentiment Indices from Survey Comments

# 摘要

> 我们致力于提升价格情绪指数，从消费者和企业的视角更精准地把握价格走势。我们从日本内阁府开展的经济观察者调查中提取与价格有关的评论，并借助大型语言模型（LLM）对价格趋势予以分类。我们依据经济观察者调查所涵盖的评论领域及受访者所属行业的信息，判别调查样本反映的是消费者还是企业的看法，以及评论所涉及的是商品还是服务。基于这些已分类的价格相关评论，我们为一般性目的以及更具针对性的目标构建价格情绪指数，将消费者与价格、商品与服务的观点加以结合。利用LLM进行分类，能够更准确地判别价格走向。此外，整合多个LLM的输出有望优化分类效果。采用更精准分类的评论，能够构建出与现有指数相关性高于以往研究的指数。我们表明，通过依据调查受访者的行业来选取用于聚合的评论，样本量较大的消费者价格指数的相关性会进一步提高。

> We aim to enhance a price sentiment index and to more precisely understand price trends from the perspective of not only consumers but also businesses. We extract comments related to prices from the Economy Watchers Survey conducted by the Cabinet Office of Japan and classify price trends using a large language model (LLM). We classify whether the survey sample reflects the perspective of consumers or businesses, and whether the comments pertain to goods or services by utilizing information on the fields of comments and the industries of respondents included in the Economy Watchers Survey. From these classified price-related comments, we construct price sentiment indices not only for a general purpose but also for more specific objectives by combining perspectives on consumers and prices, as well as goods and services. It becomes possible to achieve a more accurate classification of price directions by employing a LLM for classification. Furthermore, integrating the outputs of multiple LLMs suggests the potential for the better performance of the classification. The use of more accurately classified comments allows for the construction of an index with a higher correlation to existing indices than previous studies. We demonstrate that the correlation of the price index for consumers, which has a larger sample size, is further enhanced by selecting comments for aggregation based on the industry of the survey respondents.
