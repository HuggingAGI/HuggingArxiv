# 摘要

> 一个政策知识图谱能够为项目合规、政策分析及智能问答等任务给予决策支持，也能充当外部知识库助力相关大型语言模型的推理进程。尽管知识图谱的相关工作众多，但当下针对政策知识图谱的构建方法研究不足。本文着眼于林业领域，设计了完备的政策知识图谱构建框架，涵盖：其一，提出了细粒度的林业政策领域本体；其二，给出了一种无监督的政策信息提取方式；最后，构建了完整的林业政策知识图谱。实验结果显示，所提本体具备出色的表达性与可扩展性，且本文提出的政策信息提取方法比其他无监督方法效果更优。另外，通过剖析知识图谱在大型语言模型检索增强生成任务中的应用，确认了知识图谱在大型语言模型时代的实际应用价值。知识图谱资源将在开源平台发布，能够成为林业政策相关智能系统的基础知识库，也可用于学术研究。此外，本研究能为其他领域的政策知识图谱构建提供参照和指引。

> A policy knowledge graph can provide decision support for tasks such as project compliance, policy analysis, and intelligent question answering, and can also serve as an external knowledge base to assist the reasoning process of related large language models. Although there have been many related works on knowledge graphs, there is currently a lack of research on the construction methods of policy knowledge graphs. This paper, focusing on the forestry field, designs a complete policy knowledge graph construction framework, including: firstly, proposing a fine-grained forestry policy domain ontology; then, proposing an unsupervised policy information extraction method, and finally, constructing a complete forestry policy knowledge graph. The experimental results show that the proposed ontology has good expressiveness and extensibility, and the policy information extraction method proposed in this paper achieves better results than other unsupervised methods. Furthermore, by analyzing the application of the knowledge graph in the retrieval-augmented-generation task of the large language models, the practical application value of the knowledge graph in the era of large language models is confirmed. The knowledge graph resource will be released on an open-source platform and can serve as the basic knowledge base for forestry policy-related intelligent systems. It can also be used for academic research. In addition, this study can provide reference and guidance for the construction of policy knowledge graphs in other fields.
