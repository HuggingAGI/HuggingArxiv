# 摘要

> 在建筑、工程和施工（AEC）项目的全生命周期中，来自不同学科的信息持续融合，BIM（建筑信息模型/建模）愈发庞大。如此一来，用户在交互空间有限的移动设备上获取真正所需信息变得困难。为提升 BIM 大数据的价值，提出了一种基于自然语言处理的云 BIM 应用智能数据检索与表示方法。首先，探究基于流行云数据库的数据存储和查询加速策略，以应对大量 BIM 数据。接着，提出概念关键词和约束，用于在表达用户需求的自然语言句子中捕捉关键对象及其规格。关键词和约束可通过国际字典框架（IFD）映射到 IFC 实体或属性。通过在由 IFC 模式生成的图中进行路径查找，建立用户需求与基于 IFC 的数据模型的关系，实现数据检索与分析。最后，依据检索数据的结构呈现 BIM 数据的分析与总结结果。开发了一个原型应用程序，在我国最大单体建筑昆明机场航站楼建设期间收集的数据上验证了所提方法。借助这种方法，用户在信息请求方面能显著受益，BIM 的价值也将得以提升。

> As the information from diverse disciplines continues to integrate during the whole life cycle of an Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) project, the BIM (Building Information Model/Modeling) becomes increasingly large. This condition will cause users difficulty in acquiring the information they truly desire on a mobile device with limited space for interaction. To improve the value of the big data of BIM, an approach to intelligent data retrieval and representation for cloud BIM applications based on natural language processing was proposed. First, strategies for data storage and query acceleration based on the popular cloud-based database were explored to handle the large amount of BIM data. Then, the concepts keyword and constraint were proposed to capture the key objects and their specifications in a natural-language-based sentence that expresses the requirements of the user. Keywords and constraints can be mapped to IFC entities or properties through the International Framework for Dictionaries (IFD). The relationship between the user's requirement and the IFC-based data model was established by path finding in a graph generated from the IFC schema, enabling data retrieval and analysis. Finally, the analyzed and summarized results of BIM data were represented based on the structure of the retrieved data. A prototype application was developed to validate the proposed approach on the data collected during the construction of the terminal of Kunming Airport, the largest single building in China. With this approach, users can significantly benefit from requesting for information and the value of BIM will be enhanced.
