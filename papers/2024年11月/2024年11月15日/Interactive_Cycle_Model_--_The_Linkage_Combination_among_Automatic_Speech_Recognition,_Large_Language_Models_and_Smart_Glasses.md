# 摘要

> 此项研究提出了“ASR-LLM-智能眼镜”这一交互循环模型，它融合了自动语音识别、大型语言模型与智能眼镜，旨在实现无缝的人机交互。该研究方法把交互过程拆解为不同阶段和元素。语音先由 ASR 捕获并处理，再由 LLM 进行分析和解读，而后结果传至智能眼镜予以显示。当用户与所显示的数据互动时，反馈循环完成。通过数学公式围绕核心评估点——ASR 语音转文本过程中的准确性、连贯性和延迟，来量化模型性能。研究成果从理论层面为测试和评估模型的可行性及性能提供了依据。虽然这类人机交互产品尚未在业界现身，但此模型在依赖人机交互的领域提升用户体验的性能指标，也证实了其作为推动人机交互技术的实用性。另外，本研究率先提出将生成式预训练 Transformer 模型等前沿技术融入独特交互模型的构想，LLM 凭借强大的评估技术和创新运用提供了原始价值，为评估和强化人机交互提供了全新视角。

> This research proposes the interaction loop model "ASR-LLM-Smart Glasses", which model combines automatic speech recognition, large language model and smart glasses to facilitate seamless human-computer interaction. And the methodology of this research involves decomposing the interaction process into different stages and elements. Speech is captured and processed by ASR, then analyzed and interpreted by LLM. The results are then transmitted to smart glasses for display. The feedback loop is complete when the user interacts with the displayed data. Mathematical formulas are used to quantify the performance of the model that revolves around core evaluation points: accuracy, coherence, and latency during ASR speech-to-text conversion. The research results are provided theoretically to test and evaluate the feasibility and performance of the model. Although such human-computer interaction products have not yet appeared in the industry, the performance indicators of this model in enhancing user experience in fields that rely on human-computer interaction have also verified its utility as a technology to promote human-computer interaction. In addition, this research pioneered the idea of integrating cutting-edge technologies such as generative pre-trained Transformer models into unique interaction models, LLM provides raw value through powerful evaluation techniques and innovative use, which provides a new perspective to evaluate and enhanced human-computer interaction.
