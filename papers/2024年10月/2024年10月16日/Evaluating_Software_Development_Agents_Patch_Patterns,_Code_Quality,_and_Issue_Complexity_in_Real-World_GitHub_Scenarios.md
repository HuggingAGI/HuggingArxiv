> Evaluating Software Development Agents: Patch Patterns, Code Quality, and Issue Complexity in Real-World GitHub Scenarios

# 摘要

> 近年来，AI驱动的软件工程已从预训练模型跃升至先进的代理工作流程，其中软件开发代理成为新的里程碑。这些具备推理、规划和环境互动能力的代理，为复杂软件工程任务提供了创新解决方案。然而，尽管LLM生成的代码已得到广泛评估，但代理生成的补丁在真实环境中的研究仍显不足。本研究评估了10个顶级代理针对500个真实GitHub问题的4,892个补丁，聚焦其对代码质量的影响。结果显示，无一代理独占鳌头，170个问题未解，仍有提升空间。即使补丁通过测试并解决问题，代理的修改与开发者黄金补丁存在差异，凸显基准测试覆盖的局限。多数代理保持了代码的可靠性与安全性，但也有代理增加了复杂性，同时减少了重复和代码异味。代理在简单代码库上表现更佳，提示分解复杂任务或能提升效果。本研究首次全面评估了真实GitHub问题上的代理补丁，为AI驱动软件开发提供了宝贵见解。

> In recent years, AI-based software engineering has progressed from pre-trained models to advanced agentic workflows, with Software Development Agents representing the next major leap. These agents, capable of reasoning, planning, and interacting with external environments, offer promising solutions to complex software engineering tasks. However, while much research has evaluated code generated by large language models (LLMs), comprehensive studies on agent-generated patches, particularly in real-world settings, are lacking. This study addresses that gap by evaluating 4,892 patches from 10 top-ranked agents on 500 real-world GitHub issues from SWE-Bench Verified, focusing on their impact on code quality. Our analysis shows no single agent dominated, with 170 issues unresolved, indicating room for improvement. Even for patches that passed unit tests and resolved issues, agents made different file and function modifications compared to the gold patches from repository developers, revealing limitations in the benchmark's test case coverage. Most agents maintained code reliability and security, avoiding new bugs or vulnerabilities; while some agents increased code complexity, many reduced code duplication and minimized code smells. Finally, agents performed better on simpler codebases, suggesting that breaking complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks could improve effectiveness. This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of agent-generated patches on real-world GitHub issues, offering insights to advance AI-driven software development.
