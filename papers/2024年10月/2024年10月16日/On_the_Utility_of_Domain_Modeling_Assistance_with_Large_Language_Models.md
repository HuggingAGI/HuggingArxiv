# 摘要

> 模型驱动工程 (MDE) 通过抽象简化了软件开发，但时间限制、领域理解不完整和语法约束等问题仍阻碍设计过程。本文探讨了一种新方法，利用大型语言模型 (LLM) 和少样本提示学习来辅助领域建模。该方法旨在减少对稀缺领域数据集的依赖，为各种建模活动提供灵活支持，并给出有价值的建议。为验证其有效性，我们开发了用户友好的工具 MAGDA，通过用户研究评估其实际应用性，揭示其可用性和效果。

> Model-driven engineering (MDE) simplifies software development through abstraction, yet challenges such as time constraints, incomplete domain understanding, and adherence to syntactic constraints hinder the design process. This paper presents a study to evaluate the usefulness of a novel approach utilizing large language models (LLMs) and few-shot prompt learning to assist in domain modeling. The aim of this approach is to overcome the need for extensive training of AI-based completion models on scarce domain-specific datasets and to offer versatile support for various modeling activities, providing valuable recommendations to software modelers. To support this approach, we developed MAGDA, a user-friendly tool, through which we conduct a user study and assess the real-world applicability of our approach in the context of domain modeling, offering valuable insights into its usability and effectiveness.
