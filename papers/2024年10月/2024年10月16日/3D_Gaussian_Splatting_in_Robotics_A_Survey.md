Abstract:Dense 3D representations of the environment have been a long-term goal in the robotics field. While previous Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) representation have been prevalent for its implicit, coordinate-based model, the recent emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable potential in its explicit radiance field representation. By leveraging 3D Gaussian primitives for explicit scene representation and enabling differentiable rendering, 3DGS has shown significant advantages over other radiance fields in real-time rendering and photo-realistic performance, which is beneficial for robotic applications. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive understanding of 3DGS in the field of robotics. We divide our discussion of the related works into two main categories: the application of 3DGS and the advancements in 3DGS techniques. In the application section, we explore how 3DGS has been utilized in various robotics tasks from scene understanding and interaction perspectives. The advance of 3DGS section focuses on the improvements of 3DGS own properties in its adaptability and efficiency, aiming to enhance its performance in robotics. We then summarize the most commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics in robotics. Finally, we identify the challenges and limitations of current 3DGS methods and discuss the future development of 3DGS in robotics.
