> Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Culturally Inclusive Hakka Chatbots: Design Insights and User Perceptions

# 摘要

> 在文化与科技交融的时代，本研究通过开发RAG增强的聊天机器人，开创了保护和推广台湾客家文化的新途径。传统LLM虽强大，但在文化特定领域常显不足。RAG技术通过整合外部数据库，使聊天机器人不仅能提供精准答案，还能深刻理解文化细节。研究深入探讨了如何通过定制文化数据增强聊天机器人，使其成为处理复杂文化查询的多功能工具。在数字平台淡化文化身份的今天，这种文化敏感的AI系统尤为重要。研究显示，用户满意度与参与度显著提升，证明了RAG技术在增强用户体验和推动文化保护方面的巨大潜力。

> In an era where cultural preservation is increasingly intertwined with technological innovation, this study introduces a groundbreaking approach to promoting and safeguarding the rich heritage of Taiwanese Hakka culture through the development of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-enhanced chatbot. Traditional large language models (LLMs), while powerful, often fall short in delivering accurate and contextually rich responses, particularly in culturally specific domains. By integrating external databases with generative AI models, RAG technology bridges this gap, empowering chatbots to not only provide precise answers but also resonate deeply with the cultural nuances that are crucial for authentic interactions. This study delves into the intricate process of augmenting the chatbot's knowledge base with targeted cultural data, specifically curated to reflect the unique aspects of Hakka traditions, language, and practices. Through dynamic information retrieval, the RAG-enhanced chatbot becomes a versatile tool capable of handling complex inquiries that demand an in-depth understanding of Hakka cultural context. This is particularly significant in an age where digital platforms often dilute cultural identities, making the role of culturally aware AI systems more critical than ever. System usability studies conducted as part of our research reveal a marked improvement in both user satisfaction and engagement, highlighting the chatbot's effectiveness in fostering a deeper connection with Hakka culture. The feedback underscores the potential of RAG technology to not only enhance user experience but also to serve as a vital instrument in the broader mission of ethnic mainstreaming and cultural celebration.
