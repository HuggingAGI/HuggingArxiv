> Leverage Knowledge Graph and Large Language Model for Law Article Recommendation: A Case Study of Chinese Criminal Law

# 摘要

> 法庭效率关乎社会稳定，但全球多数基层法院案件积压，判决依赖司法人员的认知劳动，缺乏智能工具提升效率。为此，我们结合知识图谱（KG）和大型语言模型（LLM），提出高效的法律条文推荐方案。首先，构建案件增强的法律条文知识图谱（CLAKG），存储法律条文、历史案件及其关联。其次，利用LLM实现CLAKG的自动化构建。在此基础上，设计闭环推荐方法。最终，通过“中国裁判文书网”的判决文件实验，将推荐准确率从0.549提升至0.694，显著超越传统方法。

> Court efficiency is vital for social stability. However, in most countries around the world, the grassroots courts face case backlogs, with decisions relying heavily on judicial personnel's cognitive labor, lacking intelligent tools to improve efficiency. To address this issue, we propose an efficient law article recommendation approach utilizing a Knowledge Graph (KG) and a Large Language Model (LLM). Firstly, we propose a Case-Enhanced Law Article Knowledge Graph (CLAKG) as a database to store current law statutes, historical case information, and correspondence between law articles and historical cases. Additionally, we introduce an automated CLAKG construction method based on LLM. On this basis, we propose a closed-loop law article recommendation method. Finally, through a series of experiments using judgment documents from the website "China Judgements Online", we have improved the accuracy of law article recommendation in cases from 0.549 to 0.694, demonstrating that our proposed method significantly outperforms baseline approaches.
