> Representing the Under-Represented: Cultural and Core Capability Benchmarks for Developing Thai Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 随着 LLM 的迅猛发展，我们迫切需要评估其核心能力（如推理、知识和常识）的稳健框架，这促使了 H6 等广泛使用的基准套件的诞生。然而，这些基准主要针对英语，对于泰语等代表性不足的语言，LLM 开发则缺乏相应支持。为泰语开发 LLM 不仅需提升其核心能力，还需增强文化理解。为此，我们提出了 Thai-H6 和 ThaiCLI 两大基准，旨在全面评估多语言 LLM，并推动泰国 LLM 的发展。我们还将公开数据集和评估代码，以促进相关研究和开发。

> The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has highlighted the need for robust evaluation frameworks that assess their core capabilities, such as reasoning, knowledge, and commonsense, leading to the inception of certain widely-used benchmark suites such as the H6 benchmark. However, these benchmark suites are primarily built for the English language, and there exists a lack thereof for under-represented languages, in terms of LLM development, such as Thai. On the other hand, developing LLMs for Thai should also include enhancing the cultural understanding as well as core capabilities. To address these dual challenge in Thai LLM research, we propose two key benchmarks: Thai-H6 and Thai Cultural and Linguistic Intelligence Benchmark (ThaiCLI). Through a thorough evaluation of various LLMs with multi-lingual capabilities, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the proposed benchmarks and how they contribute to Thai LLM development. Furthermore, we will make both the datasets and evaluation code publicly available to encourage further research and development for Thai LLMs.
