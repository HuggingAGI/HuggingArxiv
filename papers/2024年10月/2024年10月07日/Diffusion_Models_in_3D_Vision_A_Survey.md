# 摘要

> 近年来，3D视觉在计算机视觉领域崭露头角，推动了自动驾驶、机器人、AR和医学影像等众多应用。该领域依赖于从2D数据源中准确感知、理解和重建3D场景。扩散模型，最初用于2D生成任务，提供了更灵活、概率性的方法，能够更好地捕捉现实世界3D数据中的变异性和不确定性。然而，传统方法在效率和可扩展性方面常遇瓶颈。本文回顾了利用扩散模型进行3D视觉任务的最先进方法，包括3D物体生成、形状补全、点云重建和场景理解。我们深入探讨了扩散模型的数学原理，概述了其正向和反向过程，以及使这些模型能够处理3D数据集的架构进步。我们还讨论了将扩散模型应用于3D视觉的关键挑战，如处理遮挡和点密度变化，以及高维数据的计算需求。最后，我们探讨了潜在的解决方案，包括提高计算效率、增强多模态融合，以及探索大规模预训练以更好地在3D任务中实现泛化。本文为这一快速发展领域的未来探索和开发奠定了基础。

> In recent years, 3D vision has become a crucial field within computer vision, powering a wide range of applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, augmented reality (AR), and medical imaging. This field relies on the accurate perception, understanding, and reconstruction of 3D scenes from 2D data sources like images and videos. Diffusion models, originally designed for 2D generative tasks, offer the potential for more flexible, probabilistic approaches that can better capture the variability and uncertainty present in real-world 3D data. However, traditional methods often struggle with efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art approaches that leverage diffusion models for 3D visual tasks, including but not limited to 3D object generation, shape completion, point cloud reconstruction, and scene understanding. We provide an in-depth discussion of the underlying mathematical principles of diffusion models, outlining their forward and reverse processes, as well as the various architectural advancements that enable these models to work with 3D datasets. We also discuss the key challenges in applying diffusion models to 3D vision, such as handling occlusions and varying point densities, and the computational demands of high-dimensional data. Finally, we discuss potential solutions, including improving computational efficiency, enhancing multimodal fusion, and exploring the use of large-scale pretraining for better generalization across 3D tasks. This paper serves as a foundation for future exploration and development in this rapidly evolving field.
