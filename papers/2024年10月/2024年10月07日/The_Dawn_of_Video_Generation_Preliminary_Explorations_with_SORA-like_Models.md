> The Dawn of Video Generation: Preliminary Explorations with SORA-like Models

# 摘要

> 高质量视频生成，涵盖文本、图像到视频的转换，以及视频间的转换，在内容创作和世界模拟中具有重要意义。SORA 等模型通过提升分辨率、运动自然度、视觉语言对齐和可控性，特别是在长视频生成方面，取得了显著进展。这些进步得益于模型架构的演进，从 UNet 到更强大的 DiT 模型，以及数据和训练策略的优化。然而，尽管 DiT 模型已广泛应用，对其全面评估仍显不足。同时，快速的技术进步使得现有基准难以全面评估 SORA 等模型的真正潜力。此外，评估标准与人类偏好之间仍存在差距。

> High-quality video generation, encompassing text-to-video (T2V), image-to-video (I2V), and video-to-video (V2V) generation, holds considerable significance in content creation to benefit anyone express their inherent creativity in new ways and world simulation to modeling and understanding the world. Models like SORA have advanced generating videos with higher resolution, more natural motion, better vision-language alignment, and increased controllability, particularly for long video sequences. These improvements have been driven by the evolution of model architectures, shifting from UNet to more scalable and parameter-rich DiT models, along with large-scale data expansion and refined training strategies. However, despite the emergence of DiT-based closed-source and open-source models, a comprehensive investigation into their capabilities and limitations remains lacking. Furthermore, the rapid development has made it challenging for recent benchmarks to fully cover SORA-like models and recognize their significant advancements. Additionally, evaluation metrics often fail to align with human preferences.
