> ClaimBrush: A Novel Framework for Automated Patent Claim Refinement Based on Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 在知识产权战略中，专利权利要求的自动细化至关重要。本文提出 ClaimBrush，一个包含数据集和重写模型的创新框架。我们通过收集大量实际案例，构建了用于训练和评估重写模型的数据集。利用此数据集，我们微调大型语言模型，构建了自动重写模型。通过基于专利审查员偏好的优化，进一步提升了模型性能。实验显示，我们的模型在现有大型语言模型中表现优异，超越了启发式基线和零-shot 学习。此外，基于审查员偏好的优化显著提升了细化效果。

> Automatic refinement of patent claims in patent applications is crucial from the perspective of intellectual property strategy. In this paper, we propose ClaimBrush, a novel framework for automated patent claim refinement that includes a dataset and a rewriting model. We constructed a dataset for training and evaluating patent claim rewriting models by collecting a large number of actual patent claim rewriting cases from the patent examination process. Using the constructed dataset, we built an automatic patent claim rewriting model by fine-tuning a large language model. Furthermore, we enhanced the performance of the automatic patent claim rewriting model by applying preference optimization based on a prediction model of patent examiners' Office Actions. The experimental results showed that our proposed rewriting model outperformed heuristic baselines and zero-shot learning in state-of-the-art large language models. Moreover, preference optimization based on patent examiners' preferences boosted the performance of patent claim refinement.
