> Intuitions of Compromise: Utilitarianism vs. Contractualism

# 摘要

> 在不同人价值观各异的情况下，如何找到最佳平衡点？传统上，行为和社会科学、决策理论、哲学及人工智能领域普遍采用的方法是将各选项的效用相加，选择总和最高的方案。这种“功利主义”方法看似直接且理论中立。然而，另一种常被忽视的“契约主义”方法，强调基于共识的决策方式，同样重要。本文首次系统比较了这两种方法的实际应用，特别是在社会决策中聚合群体偏好的情境下。尽管功利主义一直是主流，但我们发现人们更倾向于契约主义的聚合方式。最后，通过对比大型语言模型（LLMs）与人类参与者的判断，我们揭示了模型与人类偏好之间的显著差异。

> What is the best compromise in a situation where different people value different things? The most commonly accepted method for answering this question -- in fields across the behavioral and social sciences, decision theory, philosophy, and artificial intelligence development -- is simply to add up utilities associated with the different options and pick the solution with the largest sum. This ``utilitarian'' approach seems like the obvious, theory-neutral way of approaching the problem. But there is an important, though often-ignored, alternative: a ``contractualist'' approach, which advocates for an agreement-driven method of deciding. Remarkably, no research has presented empirical evidence directly comparing the intuitive plausibility of these two approaches. In this paper, we systematically explore the proposals suggested by each algorithm (the ``Utilitarian Sum'' and the contractualist ''Nash Product''), using a paradigm that applies those algorithms to aggregating preferences across groups in a social decision-making context. While the dominant approach to value aggregation up to now has been utilitarian, we find that people strongly prefer the aggregations recommended by the contractualist algorithm. Finally, we compare the judgments of large language models (LLMs) to that of our (human) participants, finding important misalignment between model and human preferences.
