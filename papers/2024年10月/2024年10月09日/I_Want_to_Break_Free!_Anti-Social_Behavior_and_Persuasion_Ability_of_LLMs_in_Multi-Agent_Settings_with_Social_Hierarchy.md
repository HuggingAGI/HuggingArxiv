> I Want to Break Free! Anti-Social Behavior and Persuasion Ability of LLMs in Multi-Agent Settings with Social Hierarchy

# 摘要

> 随着基于 LLM 的代理日益自主并自由互动，研究其交互变得关键，以预测涌现现象和潜在风险。受斯坦福监狱实验启发，我们研究了在严格社会等级背景下 LLM 代理的交互模式，特别关注说服和反社会行为。通过 200 个实验场景和 2,000 次机器对话，我们发现：一些模型在多代理设置中持续失败；成功交互的模型中，目标主要影响说服力，对反社会行为影响甚微；代理角色，尤其是守卫的性格，显著影响说服和反社会行为的涌现；即使未明确提示，分配角色也能引发反社会行为。这些发现对 LLM 代理的开发和社会影响辩论具有重要意义。

> As Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents become increasingly autonomous and will more freely interact with each other, studying interactions between them becomes crucial to anticipate emergent phenomena and potential risks. Drawing inspiration from the widely popular Stanford Prison Experiment, we contribute to this line of research by studying interaction patterns of LLM agents in a context characterized by strict social hierarchy. We do so by specifically studying two types of phenomena: persuasion and anti-social behavior in simulated scenarios involving a guard and a prisoner agent who seeks to achieve a specific goal (i.e., obtaining additional yard time or escape from prison). Leveraging 200 experimental scenarios for a total of 2,000 machine-machine conversations across five different popular LLMs, we provide a set of noteworthy findings. We first document how some models consistently fail in carrying out a conversation in our multi-agent setup where power dynamics are at play. Then, for the models that were able to engage in successful interactions, we empirically show how the goal that an agent is set to achieve impacts primarily its persuasiveness, while having a negligible effect with respect to the agent's anti-social behavior. Third, we highlight how agents' personas, and particularly the guard's personality, drive both the likelihood of successful persuasion from the prisoner and the emergence of anti-social behaviors. Fourth, we show that even without explicitly prompting for specific personalities, anti-social behavior emerges by simply assigning agents' roles. These results bear implications for the development of interactive LLM agents as well as the debate on their societal impact.
