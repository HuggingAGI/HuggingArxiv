# 摘要

> 越来越多的人关注追踪通用智能基础模型的能力。本研究对比了领先的大型语言模型和视觉语言模型在韦氏成人智力量表（WAIS-IV）上与人类的表现，重点关注语言理解（VCI）、工作记忆（WMI）和感知推理（PRI）领域。大多数模型在处理字母和数字序列等令牌时表现出色，工作记忆指数（WMI）甚至超过了人类表现的第99.5百分位。语言理解指数（VCI）也稳定在第98百分位以上。然而，多模态模型在感知推理（PRI）上表现不佳，显示出在视觉信息处理上的明显不足。较小的旧模型表现更差，表明训练数据和参数调优的进步显著提升了认知能力。

> There is increasing interest in tracking the capabilities of general intelligence foundation models. This study benchmarks leading large language models and vision language models against human performance on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV), a comprehensive, population-normed assessment of underlying human cognition and intellectual abilities, with a focus on the domains of VerbalComprehension (VCI), Working Memory (WMI), and Perceptual Reasoning (PRI). Most models demonstrated exceptional capabilities in the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of tokens such as arbitrary sequences of letters and numbers, with performance on the Working Memory Index (WMI) greater or equal to the 99.5th percentile when compared to human population normative ability. Performance on the Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI) which measures retrieval of acquired information, and linguistic understanding about the meaning of words and their relationships to each other, also demonstrated consistent performance at or above the 98th percentile. Despite these broad strengths, we observed consistently poor performance on the Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI; range 0.1-10th percentile) from multimodal models indicating profound inability to interpret and reason on visual information. Smaller and older model versions consistently performed worse, indicating that training data, parameter count and advances in tuning are resulting in significant advances in cognitive ability.
