> EvolveDirector: Approaching Advanced Text-to-Image Generation with Large Vision-Language Models

# 摘要

> 生成模型在创造精彩内容方面展现了非凡能力，但多数依赖专有高质量数据，甚至有些仅通过 API 提供服务，限制了其对下游任务的贡献。为此，我们推出了 EvolveDirector，旨在利用公开资源训练出媲美顶尖模型的文本到图像生成能力。通过与高级模型的公共 API 互动，EvolveDirector 收集文本-图像数据对，训练基础模型。实验显示，基于高级模型生成数据训练的模型，其生成能力接近原版，但需千万级样本，耗时且成本高昂，尤其是 API 调用费用。为应对这一挑战，我们引入预训练的视觉-语言模型 (VLM)，动态优化训练数据集，显著减少数据需求。此外，EvolveDirector 还能从多个高级模型中精选最佳样本，培养出强大且平衡的能力。最终模型 Edgen 表现超越了这些高级模型，相关代码和模型权重已公开于 https://github.com/showlab/EvolveDirector。

> Recent advancements in generation models have showcased remarkable capabilities in generating fantastic content. However, most of them are trained on proprietary high-quality data, and some models withhold their parameters and only provide accessible application programming interfaces (APIs), limiting their benefits for downstream tasks. To explore the feasibility of training a text-to-image generation model comparable to advanced models using publicly available resources, we introduce EvolveDirector. This framework interacts with advanced models through their public APIs to obtain text-image data pairs to train a base model. Our experiments with extensive data indicate that the model trained on generated data of the advanced model can approximate its generation capability. However, it requires large-scale samples of 10 million or more. This incurs significant expenses in time, computational resources, and especially the costs associated with calling fee-based APIs. To address this problem, we leverage pre-trained large vision-language models (VLMs) to guide the evolution of the base model. VLM continuously evaluates the base model during training and dynamically updates and refines the training dataset by the discrimination, expansion, deletion, and mutation operations. Experimental results show that this paradigm significantly reduces the required data volume. Furthermore, when approaching multiple advanced models, EvolveDirector can select the best samples generated by them to learn powerful and balanced abilities. The final trained model Edgen is demonstrated to outperform these advanced models. The code and model weights are available at https://github.com/showlab/EvolveDirector.
