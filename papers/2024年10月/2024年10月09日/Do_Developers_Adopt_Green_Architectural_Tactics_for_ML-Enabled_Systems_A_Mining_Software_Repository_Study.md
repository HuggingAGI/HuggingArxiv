> Do Developers Adopt Green Architectural Tactics for ML-Enabled Systems? A Mining Software Repository Study

# 摘要

> 随着 ML 和 AI 技术在社会中的普及，其环境可持续性问题日益受到关注。开发和部署 ML 系统，尤其是在训练和推理阶段，资源消耗巨大，引发了可持续性问题。绿色 AI 应运而生，旨在减少 AI 的计算需求，同时保持其准确性。尽管已有研究提出了多种绿色策略，但对于这些策略在实际项目中的应用情况以及是否存在其他未记录的实践，仍缺乏深入了解。本文通过分析 GitHub 上 168 个开源 ML 项目，评估了绿色策略的采用情况，并引入了一种基于大型语言模型的新型挖掘机制，用于识别和分析这些策略。研究结果不仅揭示了文献中绿色策略的实际应用情况，还新增了 12 种策略，并附有代码示例，以促进更广泛的实施。本研究为开发更具可持续性的 ML 系统提供了实际指导，帮助开发者在最小化努力的情况下实现显著的环境效益，并为未来自动化整合这些策略的研究铺平了道路。

> As machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies become increasingly prevalent in society, concerns about their environmental sustainability have grown. Developing and deploying ML-enabled systems, especially during training and inference, are resource-intensive, raising sustainability issues. Green AI has emerged as a response, advocating for reducing the computational demands of AI while maintaining accuracy. While recent research has identified various green tactics for developing sustainable ML-enabled systems, there is a gap in understanding the extent to which these tactics are adopted in real-world projects and whether additional, undocumented practices exist. This paper addresses these gaps by presenting a mining software repository study that evaluates the adoption of green tactics in 168 open-source ML projects on GitHub. In doing so, we introduce a novel mining mechanism based on large language models to identify and analyze green tactics within software repositories. Our results provide insights into the adoption of green tactics found in the literature and expand previous catalogs by providing 12 new tactics, with code examples to support wider implementation. This study contributes to the development of more sustainable ML systems by identifying adopted green tactics that offer substantial environmental benefits with minimal implementation effort. It provides practical insights for developers to green their systems and offers a path for future research to automate the integration of these tactics.
