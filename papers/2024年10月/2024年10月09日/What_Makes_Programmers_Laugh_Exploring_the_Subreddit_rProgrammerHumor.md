> What Makes Programmers Laugh? Exploring the Subreddit r/ProgrammerHumor

# 摘要

> 幽默是人类交流的核心，先前研究表明，工作场所的积极幽默能提升绩效和满意度。本研究聚焦于社交媒体上的编程幽默，收集了 r/ProgrammerHumor 的 139,718 条帖子，包括文本和图像（模因）。通过 OCR 提取图像文本进行 NLP 分析，并构建多元回归模型探究幽默因素。随机抽取 800 条帖子由人工标注，评估其幽默理论关联、职场适宜性等。结果显示，预测开发者幽默难度大，最佳模型仅解释 10% 方差。但发现主题、提交时间和幽默理论间存在显著差异，冬季周末下午 2-3 点提交的“学习”主题图像帖子得分最高。结论指出，NLP 预测幽默具挑战性，讨论了评估幽默的难点和未来方向。研究成果可助未来研究，并成为软件业和教育的幽默资源。

> Background: Humor is a fundamental part of human communication, with prior work linking positive humor in the workplace to positive outcomes, such as improved performance and job satisfaction. Aims: This study aims to investigate programming-related humor in a large social media community. Methodology: We collected 139,718 submissions from Reddit subreddit r/ProgrammerHumor. Both textual and image-based (memes) submissions were considered. The image data was processed with OCR to extract text from images for NLP analysis. Multiple regression models were built to investigate what makes submissions humorous. Additionally, a random sample of 800 submissions was labeled by human annotators regarding their relation to theories of humor, suitability for the workplace, the need for programming knowledge to understand the submission, and whether images in image-based submissions added context to the submission. Results: Our results indicate that predicting the humor of software developers is difficult. Our best regression model was able to explain only 10% of the variance. However, statistically significant differences were observed between topics, submission times, and associated humor theories. Our analysis reveals that the highest submission scores are achieved by imagebased submissions that are created during the winter months in the northern hemisphere, between 2-3pm UTC on weekends, which are distinctly related to superiority and incongruity theories of humor, and are about the topic of "Learning". Conclusions: Predicting humor with natural language processing methods is challenging. We discuss the benefits and inherent difficulties in assessing perceived humor of submissions, as well as possible avenues for future work. Additionally, our replication package should help future studies and can act as a joke repository for the software industry and education.
