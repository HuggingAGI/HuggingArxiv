> Robots in the Middle: Evaluating LLMs in Dispute Resolution

# 摘要

> 调解是一种由中立第三方介入的争议解决方法。本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在调解中的潜力。我们测试了LLMs是否能分析争议对话、选择恰当的介入方式并生成合适的介入信息。通过一个包含50个争议场景的新数据集，我们进行了盲评，发现LLMs在多个关键指标上表现优异，甚至超越了人类注释者。具体来说，LLMs在62%的案例中选择的介入方式优于或相当于人类，而在84%的案例中生成的介入信息也同样出色。此外，LLMs在公正性、理解和情境化等方面也表现不俗。这些发现揭示了AI在在线争议解决平台中的广阔应用前景。

> Mediation is a dispute resolution method featuring a neutral third-party (mediator) who intervenes to help the individuals resolve their dispute. In this paper, we investigate to which extent large language models (LLMs) are able to act as mediators. We investigate whether LLMs are able to analyze dispute conversations, select suitable intervention types, and generate appropriate intervention messages. Using a novel, manually created dataset of 50 dispute scenarios, we conduct a blind evaluation comparing LLMs with human annotators across several key metrics. Overall, the LLMs showed strong performance, even outperforming our human annotators across dimensions. Specifically, in 62% of the cases, the LLMs chose intervention types that were rated as better than or equivalent to those chosen by humans. Moreover, in 84% of the cases, the intervention messages generated by the LLMs were rated as better than or equal to the intervention messages written by humans. LLMs likewise performed favourably on metrics such as impartiality, understanding and contextualization. Our results demonstrate the potential of integrating AI in online dispute resolution (ODR) platforms.
