> APOLLO: A GPT-based tool to detect phishing emails and generate explanations that warn users

# 摘要

> 钓鱼攻击日益复杂，探索新技术以全方位提升用户保护势在必行。大型语言模型（LLMs）在文本处理领域潜力巨大，但在防御钓鱼方面的应用仍待深入。本文介绍的APOLLO工具，基于OpenAI的GPT-4o，能精准检测钓鱼邮件，并生成详尽解释，助用户识别危险邮件，提升决策力。实验表明，APOLLO在分类钓鱼邮件上表现卓越（GPT-4o准确率达97%），整合第三方数据后，准确率更高达99%。我们还通过20名参与者的研究，对比了四种钓鱼警告解释，发现LLM生成的解释不仅质量高，且更易理解、有趣和可信。这些成果预示着LLMs在防御钓鱼领域的光明前景，APOLLO为此方向提供了有力验证。

> Phishing is one of the most prolific cybercriminal activities, with attacks becoming increasingly sophisticated. It is, therefore, imperative to explore novel technologies to improve user protection across both technical and human dimensions. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant promise for text processing in various domains, but their use for defense against phishing attacks still remains scarcely explored. In this paper, we present APOLLO, a tool based on OpenAI's GPT-4o to detect phishing emails and generate explanation messages to users about why a specific email is dangerous, thus improving their decision-making capabilities. We have evaluated the performance of APOLLO in classifying phishing emails; the results show that the LLM models have exemplary capabilities in classifying phishing emails (97 percent accuracy in the case of GPT-4o) and that this performance can be further improved by integrating data from third-party services, resulting in a near-perfect classification rate (99 percent accuracy). To assess the perception of the explanations generated by this tool, we also conducted a study with 20 participants, comparing four different explanations presented as phishing warnings. We compared the LLM-generated explanations to four baselines: a manually crafted warning, and warnings from Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers. The results show that not only the LLM-generated explanations were perceived as high quality, but also that they can be more understandable, interesting, and trustworthy than the baselines. These findings suggest that using LLMs as a defense against phishing is a very promising approach, with APOLLO representing a proof of concept in this research direction.
