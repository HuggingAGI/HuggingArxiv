> Large Legislative Models: Towards Efficient AI Policymaking in Economic Simulations

# 摘要

> 经济政策制定的进步为社会带来了广泛益处，激发了 AI 政策制定工具的研究。AI 通过大规模快速处理数据，有望超越人类表现。然而，现有 RL 方法样本效率低，且难以灵活处理复杂信息。为此，我们提出利用预训练 LLM 作为高效政策制定者，应用于复杂多智能体强化学习场景。实验表明，我们的方法在三个环境中显著优于现有技术。代码已开源，详见 https://github.com/hegasz/large-legislative-models。

> The improvement of economic policymaking presents an opportunity for broad societal benefit, a notion that has inspired research towards AI-driven policymaking tools. AI policymaking holds the potential to surpass human performance through the ability to process data quickly at scale. However, existing RL-based methods exhibit sample inefficiency, and are further limited by an inability to flexibly incorporate nuanced information into their decision-making processes. Thus, we propose a novel method in which we instead utilize pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), as sample-efficient policymakers in socially complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) scenarios. We demonstrate significant efficiency gains, outperforming existing methods across three environments. Our code is available at https://github.com/hegasz/large-legislative-models.
