# 摘要

> 理解和设计生物分子，如蛋白质和小分子，是推动药物发现、合成生物学和酶工程的关键。近年来，人工智能（AI）的突破性进展极大地提升了生物分子研究的准确性。然而，AI的计算能力与研究人员通过自然语言将分子复杂性与人类意图对齐的直觉之间仍存在差距。尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在解释人类意图方面显示出潜力，但由于专业知识要求、多模态数据集成和自然语言与生物分子之间的语义对齐等挑战，其在生物分子研究中的应用仍处于起步阶段。为此，我们推出了InstructBioMol，一种创新的LLM，通过全面对齐自然语言、分子和蛋白质，弥合了这一差距。该模型不仅能处理多模态生物分子输入，还能让研究人员用自然语言表达设计目标，生成满足精确生物需求的生物分子。实验证明，InstructBioMol能根据人类指令理解和设计生物分子，显著提升了药物分子的结合亲和力和酶的设计性能，展示了其在现实世界生物分子研究中的巨大潜力。

> Understanding and designing biomolecules, such as proteins and small molecules, is central to advancing drug discovery, synthetic biology, and enzyme engineering. Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have revolutionized biomolecular research, achieving remarkable accuracy in biomolecular prediction and design. However, a critical gap remains between AI's computational power and researchers' intuition, using natural language to align molecular complexity with human intentions. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential to interpret human intentions, yet their application to biomolecular research remains nascent due to challenges including specialized knowledge requirements, multimodal data integration, and semantic alignment between natural language and biomolecules. To address these limitations, we present InstructBioMol, a novel LLM designed to bridge natural language and biomolecules through a comprehensive any-to-any alignment of natural language, molecules, and proteins. This model can integrate multimodal biomolecules as input, and enable researchers to articulate design goals in natural language, providing biomolecular outputs that meet precise biological needs. Experimental results demonstrate InstructBioMol can understand and design biomolecules following human instructions. Notably, it can generate drug molecules with a 10% improvement in binding affinity and design enzymes that achieve an ESP Score of 70.4, making it the only method to surpass the enzyme-substrate interaction threshold of 60.0 recommended by the ESP developer. This highlights its potential to transform real-world biomolecular research.
