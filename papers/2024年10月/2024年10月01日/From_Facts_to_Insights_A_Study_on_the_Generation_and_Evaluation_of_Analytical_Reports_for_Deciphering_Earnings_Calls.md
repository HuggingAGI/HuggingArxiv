> From Facts to Insights: A Study on the Generation and Evaluation of Analytical Reports for Deciphering Earnings Calls

# 摘要

> 本文探讨了 LLM 在从盈利电话中生成和评估分析报告中的应用。我们设计了多代理框架，引入多样化观点和理想分析主题，生成更具洞察力的报告。研究发现，尽管人类专家的报告更受欢迎，但更多代理的引入确实提升了报告质量。此外，我们还深入探讨了 LLM 在不同环境下评估报告质量的优劣，发现其与人类专家的评估高度一致。

> This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the generation and evaluation of analytical reports derived from Earnings Calls (ECs). Addressing a current gap in research, we explore the generation of analytical reports with LLMs in a multi-agent framework, designing specialized agents that introduce diverse viewpoints and desirable topics of analysis into the report generation process. Through multiple analyses, we examine the alignment between generated and human-written reports and the impact of both individual and collective agents. Our findings suggest that the introduction of additional agents results in more insightful reports, although reports generated by human experts remain preferred in the majority of cases. Finally, we address the challenging issue of report evaluation, we examine the limitations and strengths of LLMs in assessing the quality of generated reports in different settings, revealing a significant correlation with human experts across multiple dimensions.
