> Optimizing Token Usage on Large Language Model Conversations Using the Design Structure Matrix

# 摘要

> 随着大型语言模型在各领域的普及，减少令牌使用成为关键，尤其是在API服务的LLM中，需应对短上下文窗口、输出限制及成本等挑战。本研究将工程设计中的设计结构矩阵（DSM）引入LLM对话优化，通过聚类和排序等工具，有效组织航天器设计相关对话，减少单次传输的令牌量，并优化上下文窗口分配。此举不仅丰富了令牌优化方法，更为工程设计与LLM的融合打开了新篇章。

> As Large Language Models become ubiquitous in many sectors and tasks, there is a need to reduce token usage, overcoming challenges such as short context windows, limited output sizes, and costs associated with token intake and generation, especially in API-served LLMs. This work brings the Design Structure Matrix from the engineering design discipline into LLM conversation optimization. Applied to a use case in which the LLM conversation is about the design of a spacecraft and its subsystems, the DSM, with its analysis tools such as clustering and sequencing, demonstrates being an effective tool to organize the conversation, minimizing the number of tokens sent to or retrieved from the LLM at once, as well as grouping chunks that can be allocated to different context windows. Hence, this work broadens the current set of methodologies for token usage optimization and opens new avenues for the integration of engineering design practices into LLMs.
