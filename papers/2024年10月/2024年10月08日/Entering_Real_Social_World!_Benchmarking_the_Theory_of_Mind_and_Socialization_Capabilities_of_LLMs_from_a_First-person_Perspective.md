> Entering Real Social World! Benchmarking the Theory of Mind and Socialization Capabilities of LLMs from a First-person Perspective

# 摘要

> 在社会世界中，人类能推断他人心理状态（如情绪、信念和意图），即心智理论（ToM），同时自身心理状态随社会情境演变，称为社会化。这两者构成人类社交基础。在AI时代，尤其是LLMs发展中，我们好奇：LLMs的ToM和社会化能力如何？AI能否真正融入社会？现有研究将LLMs视为第三者视角的被动观察者。然而，从第一人称视角观察世界是人类和AI的自然方式，这一视角下LLMs的ToM和社会化能力尚未探索。为此，我们推出EgoSocialArena框架，从第一人称视角评估LLMs的ToM和社会化能力。该框架包含静态和交互两个环境，涵盖日常生活、反事实等七个场景，共2,195个数据条目。通过EgoSocialArena，我们对九个先进LLMs进行全面评估，揭示了LLMs未来发展和当前能力水平的关键见解。

> In the social world, humans possess the capability to infer and reason about others mental states (such as emotions, beliefs, and intentions), known as the Theory of Mind (ToM). Simultaneously, humans own mental states evolve in response to social situations, a capability we refer to as socialization. Together, these capabilities form the foundation of human social interaction. In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), especially with the development of large language models (LLMs), we raise an intriguing question: How do LLMs perform in terms of ToM and socialization capabilities? And more broadly, can these AI models truly enter and navigate the real social world? Existing research evaluating LLMs ToM and socialization capabilities by positioning LLMs as passive observers from a third person perspective, rather than as active participants. However, compared to the third-person perspective, observing and understanding the world from an egocentric first person perspective is a natural approach for both humans and AI agents. The ToM and socialization capabilities of LLMs from a first person perspective, a crucial attribute for advancing embodied AI agents, remain unexplored. To answer the aforementioned questions and bridge the research gap, we introduce EgoSocialArena, a novel framework designed to evaluate and investigate the ToM and socialization capabilities of LLMs from a first person perspective. It encompasses two evaluation environments: static environment and interactive environment, with seven scenarios: Daily Life, Counterfactual, New World, Blackjack, Number Guessing, and Limit Texas Hold em, totaling 2,195 data entries. With EgoSocialArena, we have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of nine advanced LLMs and observed some key insights regarding the future development of LLMs as well as the capabilities levels of the most advanced LLMs currently available.
