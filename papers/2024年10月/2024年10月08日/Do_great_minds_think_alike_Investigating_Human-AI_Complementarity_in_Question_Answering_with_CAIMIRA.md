# 摘要

> 近期 LLM 的进步引发了对 AI 在 NLP 任务中超越人类的讨论。我们通过 CAIMIRA 框架，基于 IRT 理论，对 QA 代理（包括人类和 AI）的问题解决能力进行了量化评估。分析了 30 万条回答后，我们发现人类在溯因和概念推理上表现更佳，而 GPT-4 和 LLaMA 在信息检索和事实推理上更胜一筹。这些结果提示我们，未来的 QA 任务应更多关注高阶推理和跨情境知识应用，以推动 AI 更好地模拟人类认知能力。

> Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) have led to claims of AI surpassing humans in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as textual understanding and reasoning. This work investigates these assertions by introducing CAIMIRA, a novel framework rooted in item response theory (IRT) that enables quantitative assessment and comparison of problem-solving abilities of question-answering (QA) agents: humans and AI systems. Through analysis of over 300,000 responses from ~70 AI systems and 155 humans across thousands of quiz questions, CAIMIRA uncovers distinct proficiency patterns in knowledge domains and reasoning skills. Humans outperform AI systems in knowledge-grounded abductive and conceptual reasoning, while state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 and LLaMA show superior performance on targeted information retrieval and fact-based reasoning, particularly when information gaps are well-defined and addressable through pattern matching or data retrieval. These findings highlight the need for future QA tasks to focus on questions that challenge not only higher-order reasoning and scientific thinking, but also demand nuanced linguistic interpretation and cross-contextual knowledge application, helping advance AI developments that better emulate or complement human cognitive abilities in real-world problem-solving.
