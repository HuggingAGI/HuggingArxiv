> Joint Extraction and Classification of Danish Competences for Job Matching

# 摘要

> 能力的匹配，比如技能、职业或者知识，是候选人胜任工作的关键要素。从简历和工作岗位中自动提取能力，能极大提升招聘人员为职位空缺寻找相关候选人的效率。此项工作展示了首个能从丹麦的职位发布中联合提取并分类能力的模型。和现有的技能提取及分类工作不同，我们的模型基于大量标注的丹麦语料库训练而成，能够提取包括不同类别技能、职业和知识在内的广泛丹麦能力。尤为重要的是，作为用于联合提取和分类的单个类似 BERT 的架构，我们的模型在推理时轻巧高效。在真实场景的工作匹配数据集中，我们的模型在丹麦能力提取和分类的整体表现上超越了最先进的模型，且推理时间节省了 50% 以上。

> The matching of competences, such as skills, occupations or knowledges, is a key desiderata for candidates to be fit for jobs. Automatic extraction of competences from CVs and Jobs can greatly promote recruiters' productivity in locating relevant candidates for job vacancies. This work presents the first model that jointly extracts and classifies competence from Danish job postings. Different from existing works on skill extraction and skill classification, our model is trained on a large volume of annotated Danish corpora and is capable of extracting a wide range of Danish competences, including skills, occupations and knowledges of different categories. More importantly, as a single BERT-like architecture for joint extraction and classification, our model is lightweight and efficient at inference. On a real-scenario job matching dataset, our model beats the state-of-the-art models in the overall performance of Danish competence extraction and classification, and saves over 50% time at inference.
