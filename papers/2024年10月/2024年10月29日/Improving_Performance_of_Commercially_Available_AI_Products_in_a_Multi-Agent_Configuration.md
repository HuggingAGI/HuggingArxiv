# 摘要

> 近年来，随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的迅猛进步，多智能体系统在实际应用中的能力不断提升。与此同时，软件开发行业研发出众多由人工智能驱动的新工具，优化了软件开发生命周期（SDLC）。在学术领域，多智能体系统对SDLC的作用备受关注。然而，尽管单智能体系统在实际应用中屡被研究，但在多智能体系统中，公开可用的商业工具协同工作并带来显著改进的实例相对较少。在此实验中，我们测试了Crowdbotics PRD AI（一款利用人工智能生成软件需求的工具）与GitHub Copilot（一款人工智能配对编程工具）之间的上下文共享。通过共享PRD AI的业务需求，GitHub Copilot的代码建议能力提升了13.8%，开发人员的任务成功率提高了24.5%——这展现了一个商业可用的人工智能系统携手合作并取得良好成效的实例。

> In recent years, with the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), multi-agent systems have become increasingly more capable of practical application. At the same time, the software development industry has had a number of new AI-powered tools developed that improve the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Academically, much attention has been paid to the role of multi-agent systems to the SDLC. And, while single-agent systems have frequently been examined in real-world applications, we have seen comparatively few real-world examples of publicly available commercial tools working together in a multi-agent system with measurable improvements. In this experiment we test context sharing between Crowdbotics PRD AI, a tool for generating software requirements using AI, and GitHub Copilot, an AI pair-programming tool. By sharing business requirements from PRD AI, we improve the code suggestion capabilities of GitHub Copilot by 13.8% and developer task success rate by 24.5% -- demonstrating a real-world example of commercially-available AI systems working together with improved outcomes.
