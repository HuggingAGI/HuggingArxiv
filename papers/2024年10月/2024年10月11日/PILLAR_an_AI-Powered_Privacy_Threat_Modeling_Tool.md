> PILLAR: an AI-Powered Privacy Threat Modeling Tool

# 摘要

> 随着大型语言模型（LLM）的迅猛发展，人工智能在隐私工程等众多领域的应用前景愈发广阔。然而，随着应用处理敏感数据的频率增加，隐私保护变得尤为关键。为有效防御隐私威胁，需在系统开发初期识别并应对潜在风险。LINDDUN 等框架虽提供了系统化的风险识别方法，但往往依赖大量人工操作、专家知识和详尽的系统理解，导致过程繁琐且易出错。当前的隐私威胁建模方法，如 LINDDUN，虽能通过复杂的数据流图（DFD）和系统描述精准定位问题，但操作复杂，且生成的威胁列表缺乏优先级指导，令开发者无所适从。为此，我们推出了 PILLAR（结合 LINDDUN 与 LLM 分析的隐私风险识别工具），通过整合 LLM 与 LINDDUN 框架，自动化生成 DFD、威胁分类及风险优先级，大幅简化流程，提升效率与准确性，同时减轻开发者和隐私专家的负担。

> The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has unlocked new possibilities for applying artificial intelligence across a wide range of fields, including privacy engineering. As modern applications increasingly handle sensitive user data, safeguarding privacy has become more critical than ever. To protect privacy effectively, potential threats need to be identified and addressed early in the system development process. Frameworks like LINDDUN offer structured approaches for uncovering these risks, but despite their value, they often demand substantial manual effort, expert input, and detailed system knowledge. This makes the process time-consuming and prone to errors. Current privacy threat modeling methods, such as LINDDUN, typically rely on creating and analyzing complex data flow diagrams (DFDs) and system descriptions to pinpoint potential privacy issues. While these approaches are thorough, they can be cumbersome, relying heavily on the precision of the data provided by users. Moreover, they often generate a long list of threats without clear guidance on how to prioritize them, leaving developers unsure of where to focus their efforts. In response to these challenges, we introduce PILLAR (Privacy risk Identification with LINDDUN and LLM Analysis Report), a new tool that integrates LLMs with the LINDDUN framework to streamline and enhance privacy threat modeling. PILLAR automates key parts of the LINDDUN process, such as generating DFDs, classifying threats, and prioritizing risks. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, PILLAR can take natural language descriptions of systems and transform them into comprehensive threat models with minimal input from users, reducing the workload on developers and privacy experts while improving the efficiency and accuracy of the process.
