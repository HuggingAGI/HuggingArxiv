> PILLAR: an AI-Powered Privacy Threat Modeling Tool

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型 (LLM) 的迅猛发展为人工智能在多个领域的应用带来了新机遇，隐私工程便是其中之一。随着应用处理敏感数据的频率增加，隐私保护变得尤为关键。为有效防护隐私，系统开发初期需识别并应对潜在威胁。LINDDUN 等框架虽提供了揭示风险的结构化方法，但常需大量人工、专家知识和系统细节，导致过程繁琐且易错。当前的隐私威胁建模方法，如 LINDDUN，依赖复杂的 DFD 和系统描述来发现隐私问题，虽详尽但操作繁重，且依赖用户数据的准确性。此外，这些方法常生成冗长的威胁列表，却缺乏明确的优先级指导，令开发者无所适从。为此，我们推出 PILLAR（结合 LINDDUN 和 LLM 分析的隐私风险识别工具），通过整合 LLM 与 LINDDUN 框架，简化并强化隐私威胁建模。PILLAR 自动化了 DFD 生成、威胁分类和风险优先级等关键步骤，利用 LLM 能力，将系统自然语言描述转化为全面威胁模型，大幅减少用户输入，提升效率与准确性，减轻开发者和隐私专家的负担。

> The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has unlocked new possibilities for applying artificial intelligence across a wide range of fields, including privacy engineering. As modern applications increasingly handle sensitive user data, safeguarding privacy has become more critical than ever. To protect privacy effectively, potential threats need to be identified and addressed early in the system development process. Frameworks like LINDDUN offer structured approaches for uncovering these risks, but despite their value, they often demand substantial manual effort, expert input, and detailed system knowledge. This makes the process time-consuming and prone to errors. Current privacy threat modeling methods, such as LINDDUN, typically rely on creating and analyzing complex data flow diagrams (DFDs) and system descriptions to pinpoint potential privacy issues. While these approaches are thorough, they can be cumbersome, relying heavily on the precision of the data provided by users. Moreover, they often generate a long list of threats without clear guidance on how to prioritize them, leaving developers unsure of where to focus their efforts. In response to these challenges, we introduce PILLAR (Privacy risk Identification with LINDDUN and LLM Analysis Report), a new tool that integrates LLMs with the LINDDUN framework to streamline and enhance privacy threat modeling. PILLAR automates key parts of the LINDDUN process, such as generating DFDs, classifying threats, and prioritizing risks. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, PILLAR can take natural language descriptions of systems and transform them into comprehensive threat models with minimal input from users, reducing the workload on developers and privacy experts while improving the efficiency and accuracy of the process.
