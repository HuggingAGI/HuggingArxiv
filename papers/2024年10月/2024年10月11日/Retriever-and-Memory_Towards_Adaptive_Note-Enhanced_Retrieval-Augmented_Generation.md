> Retriever-and-Memory: Towards Adaptive Note-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation

# 摘要

> RAG 通过引入外部知识，解决了 LLM 在 OpenQA 任务中生成错误和幻觉的问题。然而，现有方法在复杂问答中，未能准确判断检索时机，导致信息不足，答案质量低下。为此，我们提出了 Adaptive-Note，一种包含迭代信息收集、自适应记忆审查和任务导向生成的 RAG 方法。Adaptive-Note 通过笔记形式迭代更新知识，增强交互，并采用自适应策略决定检索与停止时机，确保充分探索。实验结果显示，Adaptive-Note 在复杂问答任务中表现优异。代码和数据详见 https://github.com/thunlp/Adaptive-Note。

> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates issues of the factual errors and hallucinated outputs generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) in open-domain question-answering tasks (OpenQA) via introducing external knowledge. For complex QA, however, existing RAG methods use LLMs to actively predict retrieval timing and directly use the retrieved information for generation, regardless of whether the retrieval timing accurately reflects the actual information needs, or sufficiently considers prior retrieved knowledge, which may result in insufficient information gathering and interaction, yielding low-quality answers. To address these, we propose a generic RAG approach called Adaptive Note-Enhanced RAG (Adaptive-Note) for complex QA tasks, which includes the iterative information collector, adaptive memory reviewer, and task-oriented generator, while following a new Retriever-and-Memory paradigm. Specifically, Adaptive-Note introduces an overarching view of knowledge growth, iteratively gathering new information in the form of notes and updating them into the existing optimal knowledge structure, enhancing high-quality knowledge interactions. In addition, we employ an adaptive, note-based stop-exploration strategy to decide "what to retrieve and when to stop" to encourage sufficient knowledge exploration. We conduct extensive experiments on five complex QA datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method and its components.
