# 摘要

> 基础模型的进步在图形设计生成方面展现出潜力。一些研究采用大型多模态模型 (LMM) 评估设计质量，但其可靠性尚不明确。我们通过比较基于 GPT 的评估与基于设计原则的启发式评估，发现 GPT 虽无法捕捉细节，但与人类注释高度相关，且与启发式指标趋势相似，表明其具备评估设计质量的能力。数据集链接：https://cyberagentailab.github.io/Graphic-design-evaluation。

> Recent advancements in foundation models show promising capability in graphic design generation. Several studies have started employing Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to evaluate graphic designs, assuming that LMMs can properly assess their quality, but it is unclear if the evaluation is reliable. One way to evaluate the quality of graphic design is to assess whether the design adheres to fundamental graphic design principles, which are the designer's common practice. In this paper, we compare the behavior of GPT-based evaluation and heuristic evaluation based on design principles using human annotations collected from 60 subjects. Our experiments reveal that, while GPTs cannot distinguish small details, they have a reasonably good correlation with human annotation and exhibit a similar tendency to heuristic metrics based on design principles, suggesting that they are indeed capable of assessing the quality of graphic design.
