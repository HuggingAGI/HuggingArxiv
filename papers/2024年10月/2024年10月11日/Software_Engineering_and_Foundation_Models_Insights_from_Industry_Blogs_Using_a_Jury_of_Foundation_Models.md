# 摘要

> 基础模型（如大型语言模型）已深刻影响软件工程等领域。SE 与 FMs 的结合催生了 FM4SE 和 SE4FM 实践。尽管学术界已有相关综述，我们首次从从业者角度出发，分析了 155 篇 FM4SE 和 997 篇 SE4FM 博客，利用 AI 技术系统梳理讨论内容。我们发现，代码生成虽是 FM4SE 的核心，但 FMs 还广泛用于代码理解、总结和 API 推荐等。SE4FM 则聚焦于模型部署、系统架构等。尽管云部署仍是主流，压缩 FMs 并部署于边缘或移动设备的兴趣日益浓厚。基于此，我们提出了八个未来研究方向，旨在连接学术与实践。本研究不仅丰富了 FM4SE 和 SE4FM 的实际应用知识，还展示了 FMs 在技术文献调查中的高效性。相关数据和代码详见 https://github.com/SAILResearch/fmse-blogs。

> Foundation models (FMs) such as large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted many fields, including software engineering (SE). The interaction between SE and FMs has led to the integration of FMs into SE practices (FM4SE) and the application of SE methodologies to FMs (SE4FM). While several literature surveys exist on academic contributions to these trends, we are the first to provide a practitioner's view. We analyze 155 FM4SE and 997 SE4FM blog posts from leading technology companies, leveraging an FM-powered surveying approach to systematically label and summarize the discussed activities and tasks. We observed that while code generation is the most prominent FM4SE task, FMs are leveraged for many other SE activities such as code understanding, summarization, and API recommendation. The majority of blog posts on SE4FM are about model deployment & operation, and system architecture & orchestration. Although the emphasis is on cloud deployments, there is a growing interest in compressing FMs and deploying them on smaller devices such as edge or mobile devices. We outline eight future research directions inspired by our gained insights, aiming to bridge the gap between academic findings and real-world applications. Our study not only enriches the body of knowledge on practical applications of FM4SE and SE4FM but also demonstrates the utility of FMs as a powerful and efficient approach in conducting literature surveys within technical and grey literature domains.
