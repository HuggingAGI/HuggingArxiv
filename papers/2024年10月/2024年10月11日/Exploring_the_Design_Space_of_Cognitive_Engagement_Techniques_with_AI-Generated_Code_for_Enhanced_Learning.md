# 摘要

> 新手程序员越来越依赖 LLM 生成代码来学习编程。然而，这种依赖可能导致表面学习，阻碍技能提升。为此，我们设计了七种认知参与技术，旨在深化学习者与 AI 生成代码的互动。本文介绍了设计过程、七种技术及其初步研究结果（N=82）。随后，我们优化了最有效的技术，并通过进一步研究（N=42）评估其效果。最终，我们发现最有效的技术是引导学习者逐步解决问题，通过与 AI 的互动对话，提示每个阶段的操作，再揭示相应代码。

> Novice programmers are increasingly relying on Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code for learning programming concepts. However, this interaction can lead to superficial engagement, giving learners an illusion of learning and hindering skill development. To address this issue, we conducted a systematic design exploration to develop seven cognitive engagement techniques aimed at promoting deeper engagement with AI-generated code. In this paper, we describe our design process, the initial seven techniques and results from a between-subjects study (N=82). We then iteratively refined the top techniques and further evaluated them through a within-subjects study (N=42). We evaluate the friction each technique introduces, their effectiveness in helping learners apply concepts to isomorphic tasks without AI assistance, and their success in aligning learners' perceived and actual coding abilities. Ultimately, our results highlight the most effective technique: guiding learners through the step-by-step problem-solving process, where they engage in an interactive dialog with the AI, prompting what needs to be done at each stage before the corresponding code is revealed.
