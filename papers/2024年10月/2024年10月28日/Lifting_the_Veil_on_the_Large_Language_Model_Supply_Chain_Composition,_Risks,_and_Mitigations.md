# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLM）在智能和生产力方面影响显著。近些年来，商业和开源的大型语言模型推出数量大幅增长。众多企业将大型语言模型引入其应用程序，以解决自身特定领域的任务。然而，把大型语言模型融入特定业务场景，并非只是单纯利用模型本身，而是一个涉及众多组件的系统过程，这些组件统称为大型语言模型供应链。该供应链本身存在风险。所以，明晰可能引入供应链的组件类型及相关风险至关重要，能让不同的利益相关方实施有效的应对措施。尽管有些文献提及了与大型语言模型供应链相关的风险，但目前尚无论文明确其范围、识别固有风险并研究潜在的应对策略。随着大型语言模型成为新时代的重要基础设施，我们认为对大型语言模型供应链及其固有风险和应对策略进行全面审视，对行业从业者避免潜在损害和损失很有价值，也能启发学术研究人员重新思考现有方法、探索新的研究方向。我们的论文对大型语言模型供应链进行了全面概述，详细阐述了利益相关者、组成要素和供应类型。我们针对各类供应链利益相关者和组件相关的风险类型、风险行为及应对措施制定了分类法。总之，我们的工作探究了大型语言模型供应链的技术和运营层面，为不断发展的大型语言模型领域的研究人员和工程师提供了宝贵见解。

> Large language models (LLM) have sparked significant impact with regard to both intelligence and productivity. In recent years, a great surge has been witnessed in the introduction of both commercial and open-source LLMs. Many businesses have adopted the LLMs into their applications to solve their own domain-specific tasks. However, integrating LLMs into specific business scenarios requires more than just utilizing the models themselves. Instead, it is a systematic process that involves substantial components, which are collectively referred to as the LLM supply chain. The LLM supply chain inherently carries risks. Therefore, it is essential to understand the types of components that may be introduced into the supply chain and the associated risks, enabling different stakeholders to implement effective mitigation measures. While some literature touches on risks associated with the LLM supply chain, there is currently no paper that explicitly defines its scope, identifies inherent risks, and examines potential mitigation strategies. As LLMs have become essential infrastructure in the new era, we believe that a thorough review of the LLM supply chain, along with its inherent risks and mitigation strategies, would be valuable for industry practitioners to avoid potential damages and losses, and enlightening for academic researchers to rethink existing approaches and explore new avenues of research. Our paper provides a comprehensive overview of the LLM supply chain, detailing the stakeholders, composing artifacts, and the supplying types. We developed taxonomies of risk types, risky actions, and mitigations related to various supply chain stakeholders and components. In summary, our work explores the technical and operational aspects of the LLM supply chain, offering valuable insights for researchers and engineers in the evolving LLM landscape.
