> AutoTrain: No-code training for state-of-the-art models

# 摘要

> 随着开源模型的进步，在自定义数据集上训练或微调模型已成为开发特定应用解决方案的关键。然而，目前尚无工具能简化跨不同模态或任务的训练过程。我们推出了 AutoTrain（即 AutoTrain Advanced）——一个开源、无代码的工具/库，支持多种任务的模型训练与微调，如大型语言模型、文本分类、序列任务、视觉语言模型等。AutoTrain Advanced 提供在自定义数据集上训练模型的最佳实践，可在 https://github.com/huggingface/autotrain-advanced 获取。它支持本地或云端使用，兼容 Hugging Face Hub 上的数万种模型及其变体。

> With the advancements in open-source models, training (or finetuning) models on custom datasets has become a crucial part of developing solutions which are tailored to specific industrial or open-source applications. Yet, there is no single tool which simplifies the process of training across different types of modalities or tasks. We introduce AutoTrain (aka AutoTrain Advanced) -- an open-source, no code tool/library which can be used to train (or finetune) models for different kinds of tasks such as: large language model (LLM) finetuning, text classification/regression, token classification, sequence-to-sequence task, finetuning of sentence transformers, visual language model (VLM) finetuning, image classification/regression and even classification and regression tasks on tabular data. AutoTrain Advanced is an open-source library providing best practices for training models on custom datasets. The library is available at https://github.com/huggingface/autotrain-advanced. AutoTrain can be used in fully local mode or on cloud machines and works with tens of thousands of models shared on Hugging Face Hub and their variations.
