> Procedural Content Generation in Games: A Survey with Insights on Emerging LLM Integration

# 摘要

> 程序化内容生成 (PCG) 通过算法自动创建游戏内容，历史悠久，能提升玩家体验并减轻设计师负担。尽管深度学习推动了 PCG 的发展，但真正改变游戏规则的是大型语言模型 (LLM)。本调查深入分析了各种 PCG 算法，包括搜索、机器学习、噪声函数及 LLM，并探讨了它们的组合应用。我们还根据内容类型和发表时间进行了比较，指出了现有研究的不足，并展望了未来的研究方向。

> Procedural Content Generation (PCG) is defined as the automatic creation of game content using algorithms. PCG has a long history in both the game industry and the academic world. It can increase player engagement and ease the work of game designers. While recent advances in deep learning approaches in PCG have enabled researchers and practitioners to create more sophisticated content, it is the arrival of Large Language Models (LLMs) that truly disrupted the trajectory of PCG advancement.
  This survey explores the differences between various algorithms used for PCG, including search-based methods, machine learning-based methods, other frequently used methods (e.g., noise functions), and the newcomer, LLMs. We also provide a detailed discussion on combined methods. Furthermore, we compare these methods based on the type of content they generate and the publication dates of their respective papers. Finally, we identify gaps in the existing academic work and suggest possible directions for future research.
