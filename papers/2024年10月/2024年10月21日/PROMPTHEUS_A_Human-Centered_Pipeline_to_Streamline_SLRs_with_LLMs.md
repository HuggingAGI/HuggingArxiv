> PROMPTHEUS: A Human-Centered Pipeline to Streamline SLRs with LLMs

# 摘要

> 随着学术出版物的激增，研究人员在进行及时且准确的系统文献综述时面临巨大挑战，尤其是在人工智能等快速发展的领域。这种增长也使得普通人更难有效获取科学知识，导致学术文献在大众媒体和社会中常被误解。传统的SLR方法既耗时又易错，难以跟上新研究的步伐。为此，我们开发了PROMPTHEUS——一种利用大型语言模型自动化的AI解决方案。PROMPTHEUS旨在提高效率，减少人工工作量，同时保持文献综述所需的精确性和连贯性。它自动化了系统搜索、数据提取、主题建模和总结等关键步骤。评估显示，PROMPTHEUS在五个研究领域中显著缩短了审查时间，提高了精度，并提供了连贯的主题组织，为日益拥挤的研究领域提供了一个可扩展且有效的文献综述解决方案。此外，这类工具还能通过让总结更易被普通人获取，来缓解对科学的信任危机。

> The growing volume of academic publications poses significant challenges for researchers conducting timely and accurate Systematic Literature Reviews, particularly in fast-evolving fields like artificial intelligence. This growth of academic literature also makes it increasingly difficult for lay people to access scientific knowledge effectively, meaning academic literature is often misrepresented in the popular press and, more broadly, in society. Traditional SLR methods are labor-intensive and error-prone, and they struggle to keep up with the rapid pace of new research. To address these issues, we developed \textit{PROMPTHEUS}: an AI-driven pipeline solution that automates the SLR process using Large Language Models. We aimed to enhance efficiency by reducing the manual workload while maintaining the precision and coherence required for comprehensive literature synthesis. PROMPTHEUS automates key stages of the SLR process, including systematic search, data extraction, topic modeling using BERTopic, and summarization with transformer models. Evaluations conducted across five research domains demonstrate that PROMPTHEUS reduces review time, achieves high precision, and provides coherent topic organization, offering a scalable and effective solution for conducting literature reviews in an increasingly crowded research landscape. In addition, such tools may reduce the increasing mistrust in science by making summarization more accessible to laypeople.
