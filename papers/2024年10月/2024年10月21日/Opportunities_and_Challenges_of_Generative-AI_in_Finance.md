# 摘要

> 机器学习与数据挖掘虽在多领域大放异彩，但在语言任务的推理、理解与泛化上仍显不足。幸而，LLM/Gen-AI 的崛起，成功跨越了这些障碍。Gen-AI 技术不仅深化了语言建模中的上下文理解，还能在翻译、大数据处理、快速响应等方面大显身手，并可根据不同任务与领域进行精细调整。本文中，我们深入探讨了 Gen-AI 在金融领域的广泛应用，揭示了其带来的机遇与挑战。同时，我们详述了训练 Gen-AI 的方法，并展示了其在金融生态中的多重应用。据我们所知，这是对金融领域 Gen-AI 技术最全面的梳理。我们的分析不仅聚焦于那些即将迎来重大突破的领域，也精准指出了未来需优先关注的方向。我们更期待，这项工作能成为金融与其他领域间的桥梁，促进创新思维与实践的跨界交流。

> Machine Learning and data mining have created widespread impact across various domains. However, these techniques are limited in their ability to reason, understand and generalize w.r.t language specific tasks. The aforementioned challenges were overcome, with the advancement of LLMs/Gen-AI. Gen-AI techniques are able to improve understanding of context and nuances in language modeling, translation between languages, handle large volumes of data, provide fast, low-latency responses and can be fine-tuned for various tasks and domains.
  In this manuscript, we present a comprehensive overview of the applications of Gen-AI techniques in the finance domain. In particular, we present the opportunities and challenges associated with the usage of Gen-AI techniques in finance. We also illustrate the various methodologies which can be used to train Gen-AI and present the various application areas of Gen-AI techniques in the finance ecosystem.
  To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the most comprehensive summarization of Gen-AI techniques within the financial domain. The analysis is designed for a deep overview of areas marked for substantial advancement while simultaneously pin-point those warranting future prioritization. We also hope that this work would serve as a conduit between finance and other domains, thus fostering the cross-pollination of innovative concepts and practices.
