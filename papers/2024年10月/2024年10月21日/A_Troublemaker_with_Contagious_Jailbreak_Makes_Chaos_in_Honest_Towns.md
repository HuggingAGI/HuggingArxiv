> A Troublemaker with Contagious Jailbreak Makes Chaos in Honest Towns

# 摘要

> 随着大型语言模型的普及，它们在各领域的应用日益广泛。然而，这些模型的记忆系统虽存储重要信息，却易受攻击。现有研究多聚焦于单一或共享记忆的攻击，而现实中的记忆系统往往是独立的。为此，我们提出了 TMCHT 任务，这是一个大规模、多代理、多拓扑的文本攻击评估框架。在 TMCHT 中，一个攻击者试图误导整个代理社会。我们发现多代理攻击面临两大挑战：非完全图结构和大规模系统，这源于我们称之为“毒性消失”的现象。为应对这些挑战，我们设计了 ARCJ 方法，通过优化检索和复制后缀，使中毒样本更易被检索且具备传染性。实验表明，ARCJ 在不同拓扑和规模下均显著提升攻击效果。我们呼吁社区关注多代理系统的安全问题。

> With the development of large language models, they are widely used as agents in various fields. A key component of agents is memory, which stores vital information but is susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing research mainly focuses on single-agent attacks and shared memory attacks. However, real-world scenarios often involve independent memory. In this paper, we propose the Troublemaker Makes Chaos in Honest Town (TMCHT) task, a large-scale, multi-agent, multi-topology text-based attack evaluation framework. TMCHT involves one attacker agent attempting to mislead an entire society of agents. We identify two major challenges in multi-agent attacks: (1) Non-complete graph structure, (2) Large-scale systems. We attribute these challenges to a phenomenon we term toxicity disappearing. To address these issues, we propose an Adversarial Replication Contagious Jailbreak (ARCJ) method, which optimizes the retrieval suffix to make poisoned samples more easily retrieved and optimizes the replication suffix to make poisoned samples have contagious ability. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach in TMCHT, with 23.51%, 18.95%, and 52.93% improvements in line topology, star topology, and 100-agent settings. Encourage community attention to the security of multi-agent systems.
