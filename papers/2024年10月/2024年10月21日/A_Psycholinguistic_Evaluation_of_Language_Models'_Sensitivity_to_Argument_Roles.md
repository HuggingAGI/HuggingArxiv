> A Psycholinguistic Evaluation of Language Models' Sensitivity to Argument Roles

# 摘要

> 我们通过复制心理语言学研究，系统评估了大型语言模型对“谁对谁做了什么”这一论元角色的敏感性。实验发现，语言模型能区分合理与不合理的动词使用，但无法像人类那样在实时预测中展现选择性。这表明，语言模型检测动词合理性的机制与人类实时句子处理的不同。

> We present a systematic evaluation of large language models' sensitivity to argument roles, i.e., who did what to whom, by replicating psycholinguistic studies on human argument role processing. In three experiments, we find that language models are able to distinguish verbs that appear in plausible and implausible contexts, where plausibility is determined through the relation between the verb and its preceding arguments. However, none of the models capture the same selective patterns that human comprehenders exhibit during real-time verb prediction. This indicates that language models' capacity to detect verb plausibility does not arise from the same mechanism that underlies human real-time sentence processing.
