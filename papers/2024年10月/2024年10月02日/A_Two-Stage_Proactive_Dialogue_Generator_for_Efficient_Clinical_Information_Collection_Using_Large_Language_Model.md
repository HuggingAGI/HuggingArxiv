> A Two-Stage Proactive Dialogue Generator for Efficient Clinical Information Collection Using Large Language Model

# 摘要

> 高效的医患互动是成功诊断的关键。在对话中，医生通过查询患者的症状、手术史等补充信息，提升诊断准确性。然而，这一过程往往耗时且效率低下。为此，我们设计了一个诊断对话系统，自动收集患者信息。通过分析医疗历史和对话逻辑，医生代理能提出多轮精准查询，有效收集诊断所需信息。借助两阶段推荐结构和优化的排名标准，我们的系统克服了对话生成中的常见问题。实验表明，该系统不仅能模仿真实医生的对话风格，还具备高效、专业和安全的特点，有效提升了诊断效率。

> Efficient patient-doctor interaction is among the key factors for a successful disease diagnosis. During the conversation, the doctor could query complementary diagnostic information, such as the patient's symptoms, previous surgery, and other related information that goes beyond medical evidence data (test results) to enhance disease diagnosis. However, this procedure is usually time-consuming and less-efficient, which can be potentially optimized through computer-assisted systems. As such, we propose a diagnostic dialogue system to automate the patient information collection procedure. By exploiting medical history and conversation logic, our conversation agents, particularly the doctor agent, can pose multi-round clinical queries to effectively collect the most relevant disease diagnostic information. Moreover, benefiting from our two-stage recommendation structure, carefully designed ranking criteria, and interactive patient agent, our model is able to overcome the under-exploration and non-flexible challenges in dialogue generation. Our experimental results on a real-world medical conversation dataset show that our model can generate clinical queries that mimic the conversation style of real doctors, with efficient fluency, professionalism, and safety, while effectively collecting relevant disease diagnostic information.
