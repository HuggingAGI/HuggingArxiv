> 生成式AI在社交领域的迅速应用，引发了如何在保持精准与真实的同时，为用户提供个性化体验的讨论。本研究基于Facebook的公开帖子与评论数据，考察了Llama 3.0（70B）在不同性别、年龄及友谊亲密度的组合下，预测语义语调的能力，并探讨其在生成评论时能否再现这些差异。研究分两部分进行：第一部分分析了不同社交关系类别间的语义语调差异；第二部分则对比了Llama 3.0（70B）生成的评论与人类评论的相似度。第一部分结果表明，引入社交关系信息能提升模型预测语义语调的准确性。然而，第二部分发现，即便提示中未包含社交背景信息，LLM生成的评论与人类评论对社交背景的敏感度相当，显示LLM能仅凭原始帖子理解语义。但当提示中加入所有社交关系信息时，两者相似度反而下降，这可能源于LLM训练数据中未涵盖此类信息。综上所述，LLM虽能理解帖子语义并模仿人类评论，但在仅凭提示实现个性化评论的泛化上仍显不足。

> The rapid development and deployment of Generative AI in social settings raise important questions about how to optimally personalize them for users while maintaining accuracy and realism. Based on a Facebook public post-comment dataset, this study evaluates the ability of Llama 3.0 (70B) to predict the semantic tones across different combinations of a commenter's and poster's gender, age, and friendship closeness and to replicate these differences in LLM-generated comments.
  The study consists of two parts: Part I assesses differences in semantic tones across social relationship categories, and Part II examines the similarity between comments generated by Llama 3.0 (70B) and human comments from Part I given public Facebook posts as input. Part I results show that including social relationship information improves the ability of a model to predict the semantic tone of human comments. However, Part II results show that even without including social context information in the prompt, LLM-generated comments and human comments are equally sensitive to social context, suggesting that LLMs can comprehend semantics from the original post alone. When we include all social relationship information in the prompt, the similarity between human comments and LLM-generated comments decreases. This inconsistency may occur because LLMs did not include social context information as part of their training data. Together these results demonstrate the ability of LLMs to comprehend semantics from the original post and respond similarly to human comments, but also highlights their limitations in generalizing personalized comments through prompting alone.
