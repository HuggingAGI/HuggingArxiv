# 摘要

> 板球，凭借其复杂的策略和悠久的历史，正吸引着全球越来越多的观众。印度超级联赛 (IPL) 作为 Twenty20 板球的代表，以短短几小时的赛制展示球员才华，与传统长赛制形成对比。IPL 以其技术与粉丝互动的融合而闻名，成为全球最受欢迎的板球联赛。本研究聚焦于 Dream11，这是印度领先的 IPL 梦幻板球联赛，玩家根据真实球员表现组建虚拟团队，参与国际竞争。构建获胜团队需考虑球员状态和比赛条件等复杂因素，传统上通过运筹学和机器学习解决。本研究引入 FanCric 框架，利用大型语言模型 (LLM) 和强大的编排框架，提升梦幻团队选择。FanCric 结合结构化和非结构化数据，通过先进 AI 技术超越传统方法。分析涉及审查 Dream11 比赛中约 1270 万条数据，评估 FanCric 相对于集体智慧和简单提示工程的有效性。消融研究进一步评估生成不同数量团队的影响。初步发现令人鼓舞，表明有必要深入研究 FanCric，以充分发挥其在幻想体育和商业中使用 LLM 提升战略决策的潜力。

> Cricket, with its intricate strategies and deep history, increasingly captivates a global audience. The Indian Premier League (IPL), epitomizing Twenty20 cricket, showcases talent in a format that lasts just a few hours as opposed to the longer forms of the game. Renowned for its fusion of technology and fan engagement, the IPL stands as the world's most popular cricket league. This study concentrates on Dream11, India's leading fantasy cricket league for IPL, where participants craft virtual teams based on real player performances to compete internationally. Building a winning fantasy team requires navigating various complex factors including player form and match conditions. Traditionally, this has been approached through operations research and machine learning. This research introduces the FanCric framework, an advanced multi-agent system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and a robust orchestration framework to enhance fantasy team selection in cricket. FanCric employs both structured and unstructured data to surpass traditional methods by incorporating sophisticated AI technologies. The analysis involved scrutinizing approximately 12.7 million unique entries from a Dream11 contest, evaluating FanCric's efficacy against the collective wisdom of crowds and a simpler Prompt Engineering approach. Ablation studies further assessed the impact of generating varying numbers of teams. The exploratory findings are promising, indicating that further investigation into FanCric's capabilities is warranted to fully realize its potential in enhancing strategic decision-making using LLMs in fantasy sports and business in general.
