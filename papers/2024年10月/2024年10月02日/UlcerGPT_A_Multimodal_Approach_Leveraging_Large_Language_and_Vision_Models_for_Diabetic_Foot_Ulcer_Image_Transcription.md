> UlcerGPT: A Multimodal Approach Leveraging Large Language and Vision Models for Diabetic Foot Ulcer Image Transcription

# 摘要

> 糖尿病足溃疡 (DFU) 是住院和下肢截肢的主要原因，给患者和医疗系统带来了沉重负担。早期检测和准确分类 DFU 对于预防严重并发症至关重要，但由于缺乏专业服务，许多患者在获得护理方面存在延迟。远程医疗作为一种有前途的解决方案，改善了护理的获取并减少了面对面访问的需求。将人工智能和模式识别整合到远程医疗中，通过从图像中实现自动检测、分类和监测，进一步增强了 DFU 管理。尽管在基于人工智能的 DFU 图像分析方法方面取得了进展，但尚未探索大型语言模型在 DFU 图像转录中的应用。为了填补这一空白，我们引入了 UlcerGPT，这是一种利用大型语言和视觉模型进行 DFU 图像转录的新型多模态方法。该框架结合了先进的视觉和语言模型，如大型语言和视觉助手以及聊天生成预训练变压器，通过联合检测、分类和定位感兴趣区域来转录 DFU 图像。通过对公共数据集的详细实验，由专家临床医生评估，UlcerGPT 在 DFU 转录的准确性和效率方面展示了有希望的结果，为临床医生通过远程医疗提供及时护理提供了潜在支持。

> Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a leading cause of hospitalizations and lower limb amputations, placing a substantial burden on patients and healthcare systems. Early detection and accurate classification of DFUs are critical for preventing serious complications, yet many patients experience delays in receiving care due to limited access to specialized services. Telehealth has emerged as a promising solution, improving access to care and reducing the need for in-person visits. The integration of artificial intelligence and pattern recognition into telemedicine has further enhanced DFU management by enabling automatic detection, classification, and monitoring from images. Despite advancements in artificial intelligence-driven approaches for DFU image analysis, the application of large language models for DFU image transcription has not yet been explored. To address this gap, we introduce UlcerGPT, a novel multimodal approach leveraging large language and vision models for DFU image transcription. This framework combines advanced vision and language models, such as Large Language and Vision Assistant and Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, to transcribe DFU images by jointly detecting, classifying, and localizing regions of interest. Through detailed experiments on a public dataset, evaluated by expert clinicians, UlcerGPT demonstrates promising results in the accuracy and efficiency of DFU transcription, offering potential support for clinicians in delivering timely care via telemedicine.
