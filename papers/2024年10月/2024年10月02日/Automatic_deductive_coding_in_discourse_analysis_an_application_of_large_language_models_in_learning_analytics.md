> Automatic deductive coding in discourse analysis: an application of large language models in learning analytics

# 摘要

> 演绎编码是理解教学与学习互动的常用方法，但传统的手动标记过程既耗时又费力。随着GPT等大型语言模型的出现，自动演绎编码成为可能。我们测试了三种分类方法，包括传统文本分类、BERT和GPT，并应用于两个数据集。结果显示，GPT结合提示工程在有限样本下表现最佳。这表明，通过精心设计的提示，大型语言模型能够高效实现自动演绎编码。

> Deductive coding is a common discourse analysis method widely used by learning science and learning analytics researchers for understanding teaching and learning interactions. It often requires researchers to manually label all discourses to be analyzed according to a theoretically guided coding scheme, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The emergence of large language models such as GPT has opened a new avenue for automatic deductive coding to overcome the limitations of traditional deductive coding. To evaluate the usefulness of large language models in automatic deductive coding, we employed three different classification methods driven by different artificial intelligence technologies, including the traditional text classification method with text feature engineering, BERT-like pretrained language model and GPT-like pretrained large language model (LLM). We applied these methods to two different datasets and explored the potential of GPT and prompt engineering in automatic deductive coding. By analyzing and comparing the accuracy and Kappa values of these three classification methods, we found that GPT with prompt engineering outperformed the other two methods on both datasets with limited number of training samples. By providing detailed prompt structures, the reported work demonstrated how large language models can be used in the implementation of automatic deductive coding.
