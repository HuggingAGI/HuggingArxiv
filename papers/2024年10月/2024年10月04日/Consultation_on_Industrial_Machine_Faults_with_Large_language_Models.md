# 摘要

> 工业机器故障诊断在制造环境中至关重要。传统方法依赖专家知识和特定模型，适应性有限且需大量标记数据。本文提出一种新方法，利用大型语言模型 (LLM) 和结构化多轮提示技术，提升故障诊断准确性。通过动态提示，模型能更好地综合多源信息，增强上下文理解和实用建议。实验显示，该方法准确率达 91%，超越基线模型。这表明 LLM 有望革新工业故障咨询，推动复杂环境中更高效的维护策略。

> Industrial machine fault diagnosis is a critical component of operational efficiency and safety in manufacturing environments. Traditional methods rely heavily on expert knowledge and specific machine learning models, which can be limited in their adaptability and require extensive labeled data. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically through a structured multi-round prompting technique, to improve fault diagnosis accuracy. By dynamically crafting prompts, our method enhances the model's ability to synthesize information from diverse data sources, leading to improved contextual understanding and actionable recommendations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline models, achieving an accuracy of 91% in diagnosing various fault types. The findings underscore the potential of LLMs in revolutionizing industrial fault consultation practices, paving the way for more effective maintenance strategies in complex environments.
