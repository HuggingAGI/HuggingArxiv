> Misinformation with Legal Consequences (MisLC): A New Task Towards Harnessing Societal Harm of Misinformation

# 摘要

> 错误信息，即虚假或不准确的信息，一旦传播，无论出于恶意还是无意，都可能造成严重的社会危害。面对快速的信息交换，我们需要更先进的检测机制来应对这一问题。然而，现有研究大多只关注信息的真实性，忽略了其法律和社会影响。为此，我们提出了一种新方法，以法律问题为切入点，重新定义错误信息检测，旨在通过跨学科合作来应对这一挑战。我们引入了一个名为“具有法律后果的错误信息”（MisLC）的新任务，涵盖了仇恨言论、选举法和隐私法规等11个细粒度法律问题。我们建议采用众包和专家评估相结合的两步数据集构建方法。通过实证研究，我们展示了从问题定义到实验设计的全过程。尽管最新的语言模型和检索增强生成技术在该任务中表现出色，但仍远未达到专家水平。

> Misinformation, defined as false or inaccurate information, can result in significant societal harm when it is spread with malicious or even innocuous intent. The rapid online information exchange necessitates advanced detection mechanisms to mitigate misinformation-induced harm. Existing research, however, has predominantly focused on assessing veracity, overlooking the legal implications and social consequences of misinformation. In this work, we take a novel angle to consolidate the definition of misinformation detection using legal issues as a measurement of societal ramifications, aiming to bring interdisciplinary efforts to tackle misinformation and its consequence. We introduce a new task: Misinformation with Legal Consequence (MisLC), which leverages definitions from a wide range of legal domains covering 4 broader legal topics and 11 fine-grained legal issues, including hate speech, election laws, and privacy regulations. For this task, we advocate a two-step dataset curation approach that utilizes crowd-sourced checkworthiness and expert evaluations of misinformation. We provide insights about the MisLC task through empirical evidence, from the problem definition to experiments and expert involvement. While the latest large language models and retrieval-augmented generation are effective baselines for the task, we find they are still far from replicating expert performance.
