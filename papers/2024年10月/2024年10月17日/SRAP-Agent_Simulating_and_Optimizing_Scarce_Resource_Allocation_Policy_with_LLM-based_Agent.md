# 摘要

> 公共稀缺资源分配在经济学中至关重要，直接影响社会效率与公平。传统研究因理想化假设和数据限制而受限。我们创新提出SRAP-Agent框架，融合LLM于经济模拟，弥合理论与现实的鸿沟。以公共住房分配为例，我们通过广泛模拟实验验证其可行性，并采用优化算法。源码见https://github.com/jijiarui-cather/SRAPAgent_Framework。

> Public scarce resource allocation plays a crucial role in economics as it directly influences the efficiency and equity in society. Traditional studies including theoretical model-based, empirical study-based and simulation-based methods encounter limitations due to the idealized assumption of complete information and individual rationality, as well as constraints posed by limited available data. In this work, we propose an innovative framework, SRAP-Agent (Simulating and Optimizing Scarce Resource Allocation Policy with LLM-based Agent), which integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into economic simulations, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical models and real-world dynamics. Using public housing allocation scenarios as a case study, we conduct extensive policy simulation experiments to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the SRAP-Agent and employ the Policy Optimization Algorithm with certain optimization objectives.
