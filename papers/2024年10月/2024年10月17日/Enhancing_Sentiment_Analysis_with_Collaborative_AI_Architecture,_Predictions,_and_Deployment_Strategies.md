# 摘要

> LLM 技术在情感分析领域的突破，推动了 AI 从研究实验室走向实际应用。然而，处理复杂多模态数据和特征提取的高成本仍是挑战。为此，我们设计了一个协作 AI 框架，通过高效分配任务来应对这些难题。该框架利用 \emph{chatgpt} 和 \emph{google gemini} 等生成式 AI，将复杂情感分析任务分解为可控阶段。我们还通过边缘和云环境中的实际案例，展示了该系统在多渠道情感分析中的高效性。

> The advancement of large language model (LLM) based artificial intelligence technologies has been a game-changer, particularly in sentiment analysis. This progress has enabled a shift from highly specialized research environments to practical, widespread applications within the industry. However, integrating diverse AI models for processing complex multimodal data and the associated high costs of feature extraction presents significant challenges. Motivated by the marketing oriented software development +needs, our study introduces a collaborative AI framework designed to efficiently distribute and resolve tasks across various AI systems to address these issues. Initially, we elucidate the key solutions derived from our development process, highlighting the role of generative AI models like \emph{chatgpt}, \emph{google gemini} in simplifying intricate sentiment analysis tasks into manageable, phased objectives. Furthermore, we present a detailed case study utilizing our collaborative AI system in edge and cloud, showcasing its effectiveness in analyzing sentiments across diverse online media channels.
