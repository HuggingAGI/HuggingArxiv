> 摘要：神经科学和人工智能领域早已认识到，神经元间的“绑定”会引发竞争性学习，使网络深层能表达更抽象的概念。近期，动态（时空）表示的重要性也被提出。基于此，我们提出了人工Kuramoto振荡神经元（AKOrN），作为阈值单元的动态替代，可与全连接、卷积或注意力机制等任意连接设计结合。通过同步动力学，我们的广义Kuramoto更新将神经元绑定。实验证明，这一方法在无监督对象发现、对抗鲁棒性、不确定性量化和推理等多项任务中提升了性能。这些成果强调了重新审视神经表示基础假设的重要性，尤其是动态表示的价值。

Abstract:It has long been known in both neuroscience and AI that ``binding'' between neurons leads to a form of competitive learning where representations are compressed in order to represent more abstract concepts in deeper layers of the network. More recently, it was also hypothesized that dynamic (spatiotemporal) representations play an important role in both neuroscience and AI. Building on these ideas, we introduce Artificial Kuramoto Oscillatory Neurons (AKOrN) as a dynamical alternative to threshold units, which can be combined with arbitrary connectivity designs such as fully connected, convolutional, or attentive mechanisms. Our generalized Kuramoto updates bind neurons together through their synchronization dynamics. We show that this idea provides performance improvements across a wide spectrum of tasks such as unsupervised object discovery, adversarial robustness, calibrated uncertainty quantification, and reasoning. We believe that these empirical results show the importance of rethinking our assumptions at the most basic neuronal level of neural representation, and in particular show the importance of dynamical representations.
