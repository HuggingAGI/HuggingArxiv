> Metacognitive Monitoring: A Human Ability Beyond Generative Artificial Intelligence

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLM）与人类认知过程的契合度令人瞩目，但这种相似性究竟有多深？本研究聚焦于 ChatGPT 是否拥有类似人类的元认知监控能力，尤其是在逐项预测记忆表现方面。我们通过跨代理预测模型，对比了人类与 ChatGPT 在处理花园路径句时的元认知表现。结果显示，人类的记忆评分与其识别表现高度相关，显示出可靠的元认知监控；而 ChatGPT 则未能展现这种预测能力。进一步分析表明，所有 GPT 模型均无法准确预测人类的逐项记忆表现。这揭示了当前 LLM 虽在语言处理上与人类认知高度一致，却缺乏预测记忆表现的元认知机制。这一发现强调了人机在元认知层面的根本差异，并指出解决这一差距对于开发能自我监控、适应人类需求的 AI 系统至关重要，从而在教育和个人化学习等领域提升人机交互效果。

> Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive alignment with human cognitive processes, raising questions about the extent of their similarity to human cognition. This study investigates whether LLMs, specifically ChatGPT, possess metacognitive monitoring abilities akin to humans-particularly in predicting memory performance on an item-by-item basis. We employed a cross-agent prediction model to compare the metacognitive performance of humans and ChatGPT in a language-based memory task involving garden-path sentences preceded by either fitting or unfitting context sentences. Both humans and ChatGPT rated the memorability of these sentences; humans then completed a surprise recognition memory test. Our findings reveal a significant positive relationship between humans' memorability ratings and their actual recognition performance, indicating reliable metacognitive monitoring. In contrast, ChatGPT did not exhibit a similar predictive capability. Bootstrapping analyses demonstrated that none of the GPT models tested (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o) could accurately predict human memory performance on a per-item basis. This suggests that, despite their advanced language processing abilities and alignment with human cognition at the object level, current LLMs lack the metacognitive mechanisms that enable humans to anticipate their memory performance. These results highlight a fundamental difference between human and AI cognition at the metacognitive level. Addressing this gap is crucial for developing AI systems capable of effective self-monitoring and adaptation to human needs, thereby enhancing human-AI interactions across domains such as education and personalized learning.
