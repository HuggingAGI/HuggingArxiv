> Comparing the Utility, Preference, and Performance of Course Material Search Functionality and Retrieval-Augmented Generation Large Language Model (RAG-LLM) AI Chatbots in Information-Seeking Tasks

# 摘要

> 为学生提供充足支持需大量资源，尤其在入学人数不断增加的背景下。学生需求多样，从信息查询到课程作业辅导。为探索大型语言模型 (LLM) 的支持潜力，我们开发了 LLM 驱动的 AI 聊天机器人，通过课程资料增强答案。我们进行了一项实验室用户研究 (N=14)，参与者完成网络软件开发课程任务。两组参与者分别先使用聊天机器人或传统搜索功能，然后互换。结果显示，两种支持机制均被认为有用，但在不同任务上表现各异。学生更偏好第二种机制，即先使用聊天机器人的学生更倾向搜索功能，反之亦然。

> Providing sufficient support for students requires substantial resources, especially considering the growing enrollment numbers. Students need help in a variety of tasks, ranging from information-seeking to requiring support with course assignments. To explore the utility of recent large language models (LLMs) as a support mechanism, we developed an LLM-powered AI chatbot that augments the answers that are produced with information from the course materials. To study the effect of the LLM-powered AI chatbot, we conducted a lab-based user study (N=14), in which the participants worked on tasks from a web software development course. The participants were divided into two groups, where one of the groups first had access to the chatbot and then to a more traditional search functionality, while another group started with the search functionality and was then given the chatbot. We assessed the participants' performance and perceptions towards the chatbot and the search functionality and explored their preferences towards the support functionalities. Our findings highlight that both support mechanisms are seen as useful and that support mechanisms work well for specific tasks, while less so for other tasks. We also observe that students tended to prefer the second support mechanism more, where students who were first given the chatbot tended to prefer the search functionality and vice versa.
