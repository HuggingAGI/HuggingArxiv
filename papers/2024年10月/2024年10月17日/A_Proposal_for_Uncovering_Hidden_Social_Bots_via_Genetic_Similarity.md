> A Proposal for Uncovering Hidden Social Bots via Genetic Similarity

# 摘要

> 社交媒体平台在应对社交机器人的挑战上持续努力，这些自动化账户不仅扭曲舆论，还助长虚假信息的传播。随着时间的推移，社交机器人已进化到与真人无异，甚至出现了由大型语言模型驱动的内容生成机器人家族。我们提出利用遗传相似性算法来区分社交用户是否为机器人。这种方法能自适应地分析用户行为，使检测标准随机器人策略的变化而进化。我们的方案首先根据时间线的相似性将用户聚类为不同的宏观物种，再根据遗传特征判断其真伪。这一初步构想若得以完善，将使现有仅依赖时间线一致性的检测工具得以扩展，通过引入新指标，系统地将复杂账户分类，逐步揭示隐藏的机器人。

> Social media platforms face an ongoing challenge in combating the proliferation of social bots, automated accounts that are also known to distort public opinion and support the spread of disinformation. Over the years, social bots have evolved greatly, often becoming indistinguishable from real users, and more recently, families of bots have been identified that are powered by Large Language Models to produce content for posting. We suggest an idea to classify social users as bots or not using genetic similarity algorithms. These algorithms provide an adaptive method for analyzing user behavior, allowing for the continuous evolution of detection criteria in response to the ever-changing tactics of social bots. Our proposal involves an initial clustering of social users into distinct macro species based on the similarities of their timelines. Macro species are then classified as either bot or genuine based on genetic characteristics. The preliminary idea we present, once fully developed, will allow existing detection applications based on timeline equality alone to be extended to detect bots. By incorporating new metrics, our approach will systematically classify non-trivial accounts into appropriate categories, effectively peeling back layers to reveal non-obvious species.
