# 摘要

> 6G 网络设想提供多模态感知、无处不在的智能和全球覆盖，这为网络设计和优化带来了极大复杂性和新挑战。作为 6G 核心，无线信道是技术和服务的基石，决定系统性能。然而，如何精准描述和利用其复杂动态特性仍具挑战。为此，我们提出大型模型驱动的数字孪生信道生成器（ChannelGPT），嵌入环境智能（EI），实现 6G 普遍智能。EI 通过在线环境适应提升性能。ChannelGPT 利用多模态数据，生成多场景信道参数、地图信息和无线知识。在线多维信息支持下，网络实体为各系统层做出精准即时决策。我们还构建 ChannelGPT 原型，生成高保真信道数据，验证其准确性和泛化能力。

> 6G is envisaged to provide multimodal sensing, pervasive intelligence, global coverage, global coverage, etc., which poses extreme intricacy and new challenges to the network design and optimization. As the core part of 6G, wireless channel is the carrier and enabler for the flourishing technologies and novel services, which intrinsically determines the ultimate system performance. However, how to describe and utilize the complicated and high-dynamic characteristics of wireless channel accurately and effectively still remains great hallenges. To tackle this, digital twin is envisioned as a powerful technology to migrate the physical entities to virtual and computational world. In this article, we propose a large model driven digital twin channel generator (ChannelGPT) embedded with environment intelligence (EI) to enable pervasive intelligence paradigm for 6G network. EI is an iterative and interactive procedure to boost the system performance with online environment adaptivity. Firstly, ChannelGPT is capable of utilization the multimodal data from wireless channel and corresponding physical environment with the equipped sensing ability. Then, based on the fine-tuned large model, ChannelGPT can generate multi-scenario channel parameters, associated map information and wireless knowledge simultaneously, in terms of each task requirement. Furthermore, with the support of online multidimensional channel and environment information, the network entity will make accurate and immediate decisions for each 6G system layer. In practice, we also establish a ChannelGPT prototype to generate high-fidelity channel data for varied scenarios to validate the accuracy and generalization ability based on environment intelligence.
