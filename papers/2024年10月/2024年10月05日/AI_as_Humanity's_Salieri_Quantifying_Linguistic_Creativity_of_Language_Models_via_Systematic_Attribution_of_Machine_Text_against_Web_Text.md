> AI as Humanity's Salieri: Quantifying Linguistic Creativity of Language Models via Systematic Attribution of Machine Text against Web Text

# 摘要

> 创造力一直被视为 AI 最难模仿的人类智能之一。然而，ChatGPT 等大型语言模型 (LLM) 的出现，引发了 AI 能否超越人类创造力的疑问。我们提出了 CREATIVITY INDEX，通过从网络文本片段中重建文本来量化文本的创造力。我们假设 LLM 的创造力很大程度上源于网络上人类文本的创造力。为此，我们开发了 DJ SEARCH 算法，高效搜索文本片段的匹配。实验显示，人类作者的创造力指数平均比 LLM 高出 66.2%，而对齐则使 LLM 的创造力指数降低了 30.1%。海明威等杰出作者的创造力指数显著高于其他作家。此外，CREATIVITY INDEX 在零-shot 机器文本检测中表现出色，超越了 DetectGPT 30.2%，并在多个领域中优于 GhostBuster。

> Creativity has long been considered one of the most difficult aspect of human intelligence for AI to mimic. However, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, has raised questions about whether AI can match or even surpass human creativity. We present CREATIVITY INDEX as the first step to quantify the linguistic creativity of a text by reconstructing it from existing text snippets on the web. CREATIVITY INDEX is motivated by the hypothesis that the seemingly remarkable creativity of LLMs may be attributable in large part to the creativity of human-written texts on the web. To compute CREATIVITY INDEX efficiently, we introduce DJ SEARCH, a novel dynamic programming algorithm that can search verbatim and near-verbatim matches of text snippets from a given document against the web. Experiments reveal that the CREATIVITY INDEX of professional human authors is on average 66.2% higher than that of LLMs, and that alignment reduces the CREATIVITY INDEX of LLMs by an average of 30.1%. In addition, we find that distinguished authors like Hemingway exhibit measurably higher CREATIVITY INDEX compared to other human writers. Finally, we demonstrate that CREATIVITY INDEX can be used as a surprisingly effective criterion for zero-shot machine text detection, surpassing the strongest existing zero-shot system, DetectGPT, by a significant margin of 30.2%, and even outperforming the strongest supervised system, GhostBuster, in five out of six domains.
