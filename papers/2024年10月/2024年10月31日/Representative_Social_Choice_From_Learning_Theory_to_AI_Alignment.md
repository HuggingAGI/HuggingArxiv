> Representative Social Choice: From Learning Theory to AI Alignment

# 摘要

> 社会选择理论旨在研究人群的偏好聚合，既适用于人类主体的机制设计，也适用于语言模型的民主对齐。本研究提出了用于集体决策中民主代表建模的代表性社会选择框架。在此框架下，问题和个人数量众多，机制难以直接考量所有偏好。这类场景在现实决策过程中比比皆是，像陪审团审判、间接选举、立法流程、公司治理，还有近来的语言模型对齐。在代表性社会选择里，人群由个体-问题对的有限样本代表，依此做出社会选择决策。我们指出，代表性社会选择中的诸多深层问题能自然地表述为统计学习问题，并借助机器学习理论证明社会选择机制的泛化特性。我们还为代表性社会选择制定了公理，并用新的组合分析工具证明了类似阿罗的不可能性定理。我们的框架将代表性方法引入社会选择，在社会选择、学习理论和人工智能对齐的交叉领域开辟了研究方向。

> Social choice theory is the study of preference aggregation across a population, used both in mechanism design for human agents and in the democratic alignment of language models. In this study, we propose the representative social choice framework for the modeling of democratic representation in collective decisions, where the number of issues and individuals are too large for mechanisms to consider all preferences directly. These scenarios are widespread in real-world decision-making processes, such as jury trials, indirect elections, legislation processes, corporate governance, and, more recently, language model alignment. In representative social choice, the population is represented by a finite sample of individual-issue pairs based on which social choice decisions are made. We show that many of the deepest questions in representative social choice can be naturally formulated as statistical learning problems, and prove the generalization properties of social choice mechanisms using the theory of machine learning. We further formulate axioms for representative social choice, and prove Arrow-like impossibility theorems with new combinatorial tools of analysis. Our framework introduces the representative approach to social choice, opening up research directions at the intersection of social choice, learning theory, and AI alignment.
