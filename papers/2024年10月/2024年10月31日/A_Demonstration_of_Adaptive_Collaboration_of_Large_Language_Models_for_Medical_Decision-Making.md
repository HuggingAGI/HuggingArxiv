# 摘要

> 医疗决策（MDM）是个多面的过程，需要临床医生评估复杂的多模式患者数据，且常需协作完成。大型语言模型（LLMs）有望整合海量医学知识和多模式健康数据来优化此过程。但单智能体往往难以适应需要灵活协作解决问题的精细医疗场景。我们的 MDAgents 针对这一需求，依据任务的复杂程度为 LLMs 动态分配协作结构，模拟真实世界的临床协作与决策。该框架提升了诊断的准确性，在复杂的现实医疗情境中支持自适应响应，是各类医疗环境中临床医生的得力工具，同时在计算成本上比静态多智能体决策方法更具效率。

> Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a multi-faceted process that requires clinicians to assess complex multi-modal patient data patient, often collaboratively. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to streamline this process by synthesizing vast medical knowledge and multi-modal health data. However, single-agent are often ill-suited for nuanced medical contexts requiring adaptable, collaborative problem-solving. Our MDAgents addresses this need by dynamically assigning collaboration structures to LLMs based on task complexity, mimicking real-world clinical collaboration and decision-making. This framework improves diagnostic accuracy and supports adaptive responses in complex, real-world medical scenarios, making it a valuable tool for clinicians in various healthcare settings, and at the same time, being more efficient in terms of computing cost than static multi-agent decision making methods.
