> Thought Space Explorer: Navigating and Expanding Thought Space for Large Language Model Reasoning

# 摘要

> 近期大型语言模型（LLMs）的进步彰显了其处理复杂推理任务的潜能，通常是构建思维链引导模型通过多步思考来解决问题。但现有方法常局限于先前探索的解空间，因而忽视了LLMs认知范畴内的关键盲点。为应对这些状况，我们设计了思维空间探索器（TSE）这一全新框架，用于拓展和优化思维结构，引导LLMs探索其思维盲点。TSE基于原始思维结构，借助各类设计策略生成新的推理步骤和分支，拓宽了思维空间，减轻了盲点对LLM推理的影响。在多个层级推理任务上的实验结果表明了TSE的有效性。我们还开展了大量分析，以理解结构化和拓展性的思维怎样有助于释放LLM推理能力的潜力。

> Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential in handling complex reasoning tasks, which are usually achieved by constructing a thought chain to guide the model to solve the problem with multi-step thinking. However, existing methods often remain confined to previously explored solution spaces and thus overlook the critical blind spot within LLMs' cognitive range. To address these issues, we design the Thought Space Explorer (TSE), a novel framework to expand and optimize thought structures to guide LLMs to explore their blind spots of thinking. By generating new reasoning steps and branches based on the original thought structure with various designed strategies, TSE broadens the thought space and alleviates the impact of blind spots for LLM reasoning. Experimental results on multiple levels of reasoning tasks demonstrate the efficacy of TSE. We also conduct extensive analysis to understand how structured and expansive thought can contribute to unleashing the potential of LLM reasoning capabilities.
