> Semantic Feature Decomposition based Semantic Communication System of Images with Large-scale Visual Generation Models

# 摘要

> 端到端图像通信系统在学术界广受研究。随着对图像通信系统在数据量、环境复杂度和任务精度上的要求不断提高，通信效率、抗噪能力和语义保真度都亟待增强。为此，我们基于语义特征分解（SeFD）提出了一种新范式，用于融合语义通信与大规模视觉生成模型，以达成高性能、高可解释性和可控性的图像通信。依此范式，我们提出了一种基于纹理-颜色的图像语义通信系统TCSCI。TCSCI在发射端把图像分解为自然语言描述（文本）、纹理和颜色等语义特征。传输时，这些特征通过无线信道传送，接收端则利用大规模视觉生成模型依据接收的特征来还原图像。TCSCI能够达成极度压缩、高抗噪且视觉相似的图像语义通信，同时保证传输过程的可解释性和可编辑性。实验显示，在极端压缩情况下，TCSCI比传统图像通信系统和现有的语义通信系统表现更优，具备良好的抗噪性能和可解释性。

> The end-to-end image communication system has been widely studied in the academic community. The escalating demands on image communication systems in terms of data volume, environmental complexity, and task precision require enhanced communication efficiency, anti-noise ability and semantic fidelity. Therefore, we proposed a novel paradigm based on Semantic Feature Decomposition (SeFD) for the integration of semantic communication and large-scale visual generation models to achieve high-performance, highly interpretable and controllable image communication. According to this paradigm, a Texture-Color based Semantic Communication system of Images TCSCI is proposed. TCSCI decomposing the images into their natural language description (text), texture and color semantic features at the transmitter. During the transmission, features are transmitted over the wireless channel, and at the receiver, a large-scale visual generation model is utilized to restore the image through received features. TCSCI can achieve extremely compressed, highly noise-resistant, and visually similar image semantic communication, while ensuring the interpretability and editability of the transmission process. The experiments demonstrate that the TCSCI outperforms traditional image communication systems and existing semantic communication systems under extreme compression with good anti-noise performance and interpretability.
