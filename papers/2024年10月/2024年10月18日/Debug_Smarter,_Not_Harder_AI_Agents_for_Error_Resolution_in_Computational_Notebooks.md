> Debug Smarter, Not Harder: AI Agents for Error Resolution in Computational Notebooks

# 摘要

> 计算笔记本因其交互性和灵活性，已成为科研开发的必备工具。然而，这也带来了可重复性和错误率的问题。随着具备代理技术的大型语言模型的兴起，智能错误修复工具应运而生，但它们主要针对传统编程，难以应对非线性计算笔记本。本文介绍了一款专为计算笔记本设计的AI代理，它能像用户一样与环境互动，解决错误。我们将其集成到JetBrains的Datalore服务中，并通过成本比较和用户研究评估其效果。用户对代理的错误解决能力评价较高，但UI体验有待改进。这些发现为提升用户与AI代理的协作提供了宝贵参考。

> Computational notebooks became indispensable tools for research-related development, offering unprecedented interactivity and flexibility in the development process. However, these benefits come at the cost of reproducibility and an increased potential for bugs. With the rise of code-fluent Large Language Models empowered with agentic techniques, smart bug-fixing tools with a high level of autonomy have emerged. However, those tools are tuned for classical script programming and still struggle with non-linear computational notebooks. In this paper, we present an AI agent designed specifically for error resolution in a computational notebook. We have developed an agentic system capable of exploring a notebook environment by interacting with it -- similar to how a user would -- and integrated the system into the JetBrains service for collaborative data science called Datalore. We evaluate our approach against the pre-existing single-action solution by comparing costs and conducting a user study. Users rate the error resolution capabilities of the agentic system higher but experience difficulties with UI. We share the results of the study and consider them valuable for further improving user-agent collaboration.
