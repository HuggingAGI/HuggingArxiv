> Combining Entropy and Matrix Nuclear Norm for Enhanced Evaluation of Language Models

# 摘要

> 随着 LLM 的进步，精确高效的评估指标变得尤为重要。传统方法虽有价值，但常受限于计算和解释性。本文提出一种新型混合评估法，结合协方差矩阵熵和矩阵核范数 (MNN)。首先归一化 LLM 隐藏状态，计算协方差矩阵和 MNN，再求其熵以捕捉输出中的不确定性和冗余。通过综合评分，我们构建了一个既准确又高效的评估框架。此外，该方法允许灵活调整熵和 MNN 的权重，以适应不同评估目标。实验证明，该方法稳健有效，为模型性能提供了更深层次的洞察。这项研究推动了 LLM 评估的发展，并为未来评估技术的创新奠定了基础。

> As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the need for precise and efficient evaluation metrics becomes more pressing. Traditional approaches, while informative, often face limitations in computational demands and interpretability. In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid evaluation method that integrates two established techniques: entropy derived from covariance matrices and the Matrix Nuclear Norm (MNN). Our method begins by normalizing hidden states from LLMs, then computes the covariance matrix and MNN from these representations. We further calculate the entropy of the covariance matrix to capture uncertainty and redundancy in the model's outputs. By combining these metrics into a composite score, we offer a comprehensive evaluation framework that balances accuracy with computational efficiency. Additionally, our approach allows for flexibility in adjusting the weightings between entropy and MNN, tailoring the evaluation for different objectives. Through a series of experiments on various LLMs, we demonstrate the robustness and efficacy of our method, offering deeper insights into model performance. This work contributes to the ongoing development of LLM evaluation and opens avenues for future innovations in model assessment techniques.
