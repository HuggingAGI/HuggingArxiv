> Harmony: A Home Agent for Responsive Management and Action Optimization with a Locally Deployed Large Language Model

# 摘要

> 自 GPT-3.5 问世以来，基于 LLM 的智能家庭助手技术飞速发展。这些框架，如基于 GPT-4 的高性能 LLM，通过云计算大幅扩展了功能和应用场景，提升了用户体验。为兼顾数据处理的隐私与经济性，同时保留 LLM 的强大功能，我们推出了 Harmony，一种使用本地部署的小型 LLM 的智能家庭助手框架。基于 Llama3-8b，Harmony 在运行中不向互联网发送数据，确保本地计算和隐私安全。在基准测试中，Harmony 与使用 GPT-4 的框架表现相当。此外，Harmony 能根据用户和家庭状态自主行动，如周末晚起时自动延迟开窗帘，或回家时自动准备房间，无需用户指令。

> Since the launch of GPT-3.5, intelligent home assistant technology based on large language models (LLMs) has made significant progress. These intelligent home assistant frameworks, such as those based on high-performance LLMs like GPT-4, have greatly expanded their functional range and application scenarios by computing on the cloud, enriching user experience and diversification. In order to optimize the privacy and economy of data processing while maintaining the powerful functions of LLMs, we propose Harmony, a smart home assistant framework that uses a locally deployable small-scale LLM. Based on Llama3-8b, an open LLM that can be easily deployed on a consumer-grade PC, Harmony does not send any data to the internet during operation, ensuring local computation and privacy secured. Harmony based on Llama3-8b achieved competitive performance on our benchmark tests with the framework used in related work with GPT-4. In addition to solving the issues mentioned above, Harmony can also take actions according to the user and home status, even if the user does not issue a command. For example, when the user wants to wake up later than normal on the weekend, Harmony would open the curtains only when the user gets up or prepare the room when the user comes home without requiring user commands.
