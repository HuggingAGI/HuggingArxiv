# 摘要

> 本研究通过将 Elasticsearch 融入 RAG 框架，旨在提升 LLM 在问答任务中的准确性与质量。实验基于 SQuAD 2.0 数据集，对比了多种检索方法，包括传统关键词匹配、BM25-RAG、TF-IDF-RAG 及新提出的 ES-RAG。结果表明，ES-RAG 在检索效率与准确性上均表现优异，较 TF-IDF-RAG 提升 0.51 个百分点。此外，Elasticsearch 的强大搜索功能与灵活配置，使问答系统能更高效应对复杂查询，满足用户多样需求。未来研究可深入探讨如何优化 Elasticsearch 与 LLM 的交互，引入更高级的语义理解与上下文感知，以打造更智能、更人性化的问答体验。

> This study aims to improve the accuracy and quality of large-scale language models (LLMs) in answering questions by integrating Elasticsearch into the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. The experiment uses the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) version 2.0 as the test dataset and compares the performance of different retrieval methods, including traditional methods based on keyword matching or semantic similarity calculation, BM25-RAG and TF-IDF- RAG, and the newly proposed ES-RAG scheme. The results show that ES-RAG not only has obvious advantages in retrieval efficiency but also performs well in key indicators such as accuracy, which is 0.51 percentage points higher than TF-IDF-RAG. In addition, Elasticsearch's powerful search capabilities and rich configuration options enable the entire question-answering system to better handle complex queries and provide more flexible and efficient responses based on the diverse needs of users. Future research directions can further explore how to optimize the interaction mechanism between Elasticsearch and LLM, such as introducing higher-level semantic understanding and context-awareness capabilities, to achieve a more intelligent and humanized question-answering experience.
