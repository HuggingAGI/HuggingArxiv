> Commit: Online Groups with Participation Commitments

# 摘要

> 摘要：尽管努力提升参与度，可很多在线群组在初始阶段过后就难以存续，原因是成员流失且活动萎缩。我们指出，在线群组设计的一个重要假设——群组除了成员潜水外别无所求——或许正阻碍众多此类群组保持关键的参与规模。本文为在线群组探索了一种别样的承诺设计，即要求所有成员定期承诺参与，以此作为留在群组的条件。我们在名为 Commit 的移动群组聊天平台中实现了这一方法，并开展了一项实地研究，在三周内对 N = 57 名参与者的承诺情况与社会心理推动的控制条件进行对比。承诺使得贡献数量较控制条件翻倍，且到第三周时，87％（相对 19％）的参与者仍保持活跃。参与者反馈，即便他们紧张，承诺也为其提供了安全保障来发布信息。通过此项工作，我们认为更需努力而非更轻松的成员资格或许能支撑许多在线群组。

Abstract:In spite of efforts to increase participation, many online groups struggle to survive past the initial days, as members leave and activity atrophies. We argue that a main assumption of online group design -- that groups ask nothing of their members beyond lurking -- may be preventing many of these groups from sustaining a critical mass of participation. In this paper, we explore an alternative commitment design for online groups, which requires that all members commit at regular intervals to participating, as a condition of remaining in the group. We instantiate this approach in a mobile group chat platform called Commit, and perform a field study comparing commitment against a control condition of social psychological nudges with N=57 participants over three weeks. Commitment doubled the number of contributions versus the control condition, and resulted in 87% (vs. 19%) of participants remaining active by the third week. Participants reported that commitment provided safe cover for them to post even when they were nervous. Through this work, we argue that more effortful, not less effortful, membership may support many online groups.
