# 摘要

> 我们提出了一种利用本体对齐提升深度学习模型学习效果的框架。实验表明，经过本体微调的模型在序列分类任务中表现更佳，学习速度更快。此外，我们还展示了本体对齐过程中提取的包含映射如何增强大型语言模型的检索增强生成能力。结果显示，这种方法不仅提高了8.97%的上下文相似性，还提升了1%的事实准确性。我们还据此定义了幻觉指数，发现该方法能有效减少4.847%的幻觉现象。

> In this work, we present a framework that utilizes ontology alignment to improve the learning process of deep learning models. With this approach we show that models fine-tuned using ontologies learn a downstream task at a higher rate with better performance on a sequential classification task compared to the native version of the model. Additionally, we extend our work to showcase how subsumption mappings retrieved during the process of ontology alignment can help enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models. The results show that the responses obtained by using subsumption mappings show an increase of 8.97% in contextual similarity and a 1% increase in factual accuracy. We also use these scores to define our Hallucination Index and show that this approach reduces hallucination in LLMs by 4.847%.
