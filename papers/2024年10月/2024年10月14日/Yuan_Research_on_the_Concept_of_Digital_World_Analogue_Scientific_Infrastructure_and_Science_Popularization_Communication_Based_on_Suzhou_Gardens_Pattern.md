> Yuan: Research on the Concept of Digital World Analogue Scientific Infrastructure and Science Popularization Communication Based on Suzhou Gardens Pattern

# 摘要

> 在当今数字时代，高安全性依赖于原生安全等先进概念，但这些概念在企业和组织中的实施面临挑战。借助大型语言模型 (LLM) 的进步，我们从苏州园林的设计中汲取灵感，提取了三个并行概念，以增强未来数字基础设施的安全性。我们提出了三个指导原则，用于“空间蜘蛛”这一超大型科学基础设施的初步建设，并计划通过“元”数字花园，推广元 AI 世界模拟器的建设路径。元的初步试点将涵盖各种超大型科学基础设施场景，最终扩展到众多高安全性数字应用。通过借鉴苏州园林的设计理念，我们旨在促进网络安全领域的科学传播和人才培养，并计划将这一理念扩展到各个数字建设领域，为未来数字世界模拟器的发展做出重大贡献，强调超大型科学基础设施与科学传播和研究传播的整合。

> In the current digital era, high security relies significantly on advanced concepts such as native security. However, the design and implementation of these concepts face challenges in enterprises and organizations. Leveraging advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), we draw inspiration from the design principles of Suzhou Gardens, a UNESCO World Heritage site. By examining its core features, which align closely with those of the AI world simulator Sora, we extract three concurrent concepts to enhance the security of future digital infrastructures.We propose three guiding principles to facilitate the preliminary construction of the "Space Spider," a hyper-large scientific infrastructure. These principles will steer the development of the "Yuan" digital garden, establishing a "Chinese Series" focused on the construction pathways of the Yuan AI world simulator. The initial pilot of Yuan is expected to generalize various hyper-large scientific infrastructure scenarios, ultimately expanding into numerous high-security digital applications.Through the design concept of Suzhou Gardens, we aim to promote science communication and talent training in the field of cybersecurity. With the support of Yuan, we intend to extend our efforts to various digital construction domains. This initiative is poised to contribute significantly to the future of digital world simulators, emphasizing the integration of hyper-large scientific infrastructure with science communication and research dissemination.
