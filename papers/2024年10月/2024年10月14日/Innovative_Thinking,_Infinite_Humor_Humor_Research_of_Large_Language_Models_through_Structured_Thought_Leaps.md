> Innovative Thinking, Infinite Humor: Humor Research of Large Language Models through Structured Thought Leaps

# 摘要

> 幽默，作为人类语言中文化差异显著的一部分，对理解和生成提出了挑战，要求参与者具备出色的创造力和联想思维。与解决数学问题等推理任务类似，幽默生成需要不断的反思和修订，而非依赖于 Creative Leap-of-Thought (CLoT) 范式中的瞬间灵感。尽管 CLoT 能实现远程联想，却无法生成幽默内容。为此，我们提出了一种系统的幽默生成思维方式，并构建了 Creative Leap of Structured Thought (CLoST) 框架。首先，我们引入奖励模型以纠正错误，因为目前缺乏幽默的专家模型和判断标准。通过设计以判断为导向的指令和开放领域的指令进化方法，我们提升了模型的能力。随后，通过强化学习，模型不断优化其思维链和策略，最终生成既幽默又具创造性的答案。这些研究不仅深化了我们对 LLMs 创造力的理解，还为提升其跨领域创新能力提供了新途径。

> Humor is a culturally nuanced aspect of human language that presents challenges for understanding and generation, requiring participants to possess good creativity and strong associative thinking. Similar to reasoning tasks like solving math problems, humor generation requires continuous reflection and revision to foster creative thinking, rather than relying on a sudden flash of inspiration like Creative Leap-of-Thought (CLoT) paradigm. Although CLoT can realize the ability of remote association generation, this paradigm fails to generate humor content. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a systematic way of thinking about generating humor and based on it, we built Creative Leap of Structured Thought (CLoST) frame. First, a reward model is necessary achieve the purpose of being able to correct errors, since there is currently no expert model of humor and a usable rule to determine whether a piece of content is humorous. Judgement-oriented instructions are designed to improve the capability of a model, and we also propose an open-domain instruction evolutionary method to fully unleash the potential. Then, through reinforcement learning, the model learns to hone its rationales of the thought chain and refine the strategies it uses. Thus, it learns to recognize and correct its mistakes, and finally generate the most humorous and creative answer. These findings deepen our understanding of the creative capabilities of LLMs and provide ways to enhance LLMs' creative abilities for cross-domain innovative applications.
