> IMAS: A Comprehensive Agentic Approach to Rural Healthcare Delivery

# 摘要

> 自 COVID-19 以来，全球农村社区因医疗专业人员向城市迁移，面临医疗服务获取难题。半训练的护理人员虽填补了空缺，但缺乏正式培训。本文提出了一种先进的代理医疗助理系统，利用 LLM 和代理方法，改善农村医疗服务。该系统包含翻译、医疗复杂性评估、专家网络集成、医疗建议生成和响应简化五大组件。我们的创新框架确保了情境敏感、适应性强且可靠的医疗援助，能进行临床分诊、诊断和识别专家干预需求。该系统处理文化差异和识字水平，提供本地语言的清晰医疗建议。评估结果显示，这种集成方法显著提升农村医疗工作者的有效性，使医疗服务更易获取和理解。相关代码和材料可在 https://github.com/uheal/imas 获取。

> Since the onset of COVID-19, rural communities worldwide have faced significant challenges in accessing healthcare due to the migration of experienced medical professionals to urban centers. Semi-trained caregivers, such as Community Health Workers (CHWs) and Registered Medical Practitioners (RMPs), have stepped in to fill this gap, but often lack formal training. This paper proposes an advanced agentic medical assistant system designed to improve healthcare delivery in rural areas by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic approaches. The system is composed of five crucial components: translation, medical complexity assessment, expert network integration, final medical advice generation, and response simplification. Our innovative framework ensures context-sensitive, adaptive, and reliable medical assistance, capable of clinical triaging, diagnostics, and identifying cases requiring specialist intervention. The system is designed to handle cultural nuances and varying literacy levels, providing clear and actionable medical advice in local languages. Evaluation results using the MedQA, PubMedQA, and JAMA datasets demonstrate that this integrated approach significantly enhances the effectiveness of rural healthcare workers, making healthcare more accessible and understandable for underserved populations.
