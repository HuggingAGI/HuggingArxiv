> Sequential LLM Framework for Fashion Recommendation

# 摘要

> 时尚行业是全球电商的领军领域，促使各大零售商纷纷采用推荐系统来提升购物体验。然而，现有的推荐系统大多针对通用电商设计，难以应对时尚领域的独特挑战。为此，我们提出了一种基于预训练大型语言模型（LLM）的时尚推荐框架，通过参数高效微调与创新混合检索技术，将文本转化为精准的产品推荐。实验结果显示，该框架显著提升了时尚推荐的效果。

> The fashion industry is one of the leading domains in the global e-commerce sector, prompting major online retailers to employ recommendation systems for product suggestions and customer convenience. While recommendation systems have been widely studied, most are designed for general e-commerce problems and struggle with the unique challenges of the fashion domain. To address these issues, we propose a sequential fashion recommendation framework that leverages a pre-trained large language model (LLM) enhanced with recommendation-specific prompts. Our framework employs parameter-efficient fine-tuning with extensive fashion data and introduces a novel mix-up-based retrieval technique for translating text into relevant product suggestions. Extensive experiments show our proposed framework significantly enhances fashion recommendation performance.
