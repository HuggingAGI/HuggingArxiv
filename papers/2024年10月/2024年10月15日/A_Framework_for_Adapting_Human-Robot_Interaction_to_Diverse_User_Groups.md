# 摘要

> 为了在现实环境中实现与不同用户群体的自然互动，社交机器人需要灵活应对各种需求和期望，并根据用户反馈调整行为。我们提出了一种创新的适应性人机交互框架，该框架不仅能针对不同用户群体定制互动，还允许用户通过各种中断来调节互动。我们的核心贡献是一个基于 ROS 的适应性 HRI 框架，附带开源代码，支持通过高级语音识别和语音活动检测实现自然互动，并利用大型语言模型作为对话桥梁。通过模块测试和系统试验，我们验证了该框架的高效性，特别是在年龄识别的准确性和应对用户输入变化方面的鲁棒性。

> To facilitate natural and intuitive interactions with diverse user groups in real-world settings, social robots must be capable of addressing the varying requirements and expectations of these groups while adapting their behavior based on user feedback. While previous research often focuses on specific demographics, we present a novel framework for adaptive Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) that tailors interactions to different user groups and enables individual users to modulate interactions through both minor and major interruptions. Our primary contributions include the development of an adaptive, ROS-based HRI framework with an open-source code base. This framework supports natural interactions through advanced speech recognition and voice activity detection, and leverages a large language model (LLM) as a dialogue bridge. We validate the efficiency of our framework through module tests and system trials, demonstrating its high accuracy in age recognition and its robustness to repeated user inputs and plan changes.
