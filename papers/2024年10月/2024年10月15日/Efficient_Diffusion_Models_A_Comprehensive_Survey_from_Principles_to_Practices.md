> Efficient Diffusion Models: A Comprehensive Survey from Principles to Practices

# 摘要

> 扩散模型作为近年最炙手可热的生成模型，凭借其深厚的理论基础和可靠的应用实践，在图像合成、视频生成、分子设计、3D场景渲染及多模态生成等领域大放异彩。这些成就主要归功于其渐进式设计原则和高效的技术架构。然而，目前尚缺乏一篇全面深入的综述来总结这些成功经验，以助力扩散模型的快速理解和应用。本综述从效率视角出发，聚焦于架构设计、模型训练、快速推理与可靠部署中的核心原理与高效实践，旨在为读者提供一个友好且实用的指南，推动扩散模型在新场景中的理论研究、算法迁移与模型应用。

> As one of the most popular and sought-after generative models in the recent years, diffusion models have sparked the interests of many researchers and steadily shown excellent advantage in various generative tasks such as image synthesis, video generation, molecule design, 3D scene rendering and multimodal generation, relying on their dense theoretical principles and reliable application practices. The remarkable success of these recent efforts on diffusion models comes largely from progressive design principles and efficient architecture, training, inference, and deployment methodologies. However, there has not been a comprehensive and in-depth review to summarize these principles and practices to help the rapid understanding and application of diffusion models. In this survey, we provide a new efficiency-oriented perspective on these existing efforts, which mainly focuses on the profound principles and efficient practices in architecture designs, model training, fast inference and reliable deployment, to guide further theoretical research, algorithm migration and model application for new scenarios in a reader-friendly way. \url{https://github.com/ponyzym/Efficient-DMs-Survey}
