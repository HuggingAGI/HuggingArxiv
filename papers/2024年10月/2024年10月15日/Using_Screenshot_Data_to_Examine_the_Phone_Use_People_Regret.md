# 摘要

> 智能手机用户常对使用感到后悔，但因应用复杂和意图多样，找出界面设计如何导致后悔使用颇具挑战。我们研究了17名安卓用户一周，每五秒收集截图，用多模态大模型分析细粒度活动。结合经验采样、调查和访谈，发现后悔因意图而异，非意图和社交媒体使用尤甚。社交媒体活动中，查看评论和算法推荐内容最易后悔。当意图是直接沟通时，浏览社交媒体略增后悔。研究为提升用户体验和自主性的设计与政策提供指引。

> Smartphone users often regret aspects of their phone use, but pinpointing specific ways in which the design of an interface contributes to regrettable use can be challenging due to the complexity of app features and user intentions. We conducted a one-week study with 17 Android users, using a novel method where we passively collected screenshots every five seconds, which were analyzed via a multimodal large language model to extract fine-grained activity. Paired with experience sampling, surveys, and interviews, we found that regret varies based on user intention, with non-intentional and social media use being especially regrettable. Regret also varies by social media activity; participants were most likely to regret viewing comments and algorithmically recommended content. Additionally, participants frequently deviated to browsing social media when their intention was direct communication, which slightly increased their regret. Our findings provide guidance to designers and policy-makers seeking to improve users' experience and autonomy.
