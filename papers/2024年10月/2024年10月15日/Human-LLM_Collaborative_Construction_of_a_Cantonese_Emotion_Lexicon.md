> Human-LLM Collaborative Construction of a Cantonese Emotion Lexicon

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLM）在语言理解和生成方面表现出色。本研究通过 LLM 与人类注释者的合作，为资源匮乏的粤语创建情感词典。结合 LLM 和人类注释者的情感标签，利用多语言词典和本地论坛资源，构建了包含丰富口语表达的粤语情感词典。通过三个不同情感数据集的测试，验证了词典在情感提取中的有效性。研究不仅展示了词典的实用性，还强调了人机协作在提升情感标签质量方面的巨大潜力，为资源匮乏语言的自然语言处理任务开辟了新路径。

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in language understanding and generation. Advanced utilization of the knowledge embedded in LLMs for automated annotation has consistently been explored. This study proposed to develop an emotion lexicon for Cantonese, a low-resource language, through collaborative efforts between LLM and human annotators. By integrating emotion labels provided by LLM and human annotators, the study leveraged existing linguistic resources including lexicons in other languages and local forums to construct a Cantonese emotion lexicon enriched with colloquial expressions. The consistency of the proposed emotion lexicon in emotion extraction was assessed through modification and utilization of three distinct emotion text datasets. This study not only validates the efficacy of the constructed lexicon but also emphasizes that collaborative annotation between human and artificial intelligence can significantly enhance the quality of emotion labels, highlighting the potential of such partnerships in facilitating natural language processing tasks for low-resource languages.
