> 医学文本简化对非专家理解复杂生物医学文献至关重要。传统方法在处理专业术语时缺乏灵活性，而LLM通过迭代细化和专家协作提供了新的简化途径。我们提出了“医学简化者协会”，一个基于LLM的框架，借鉴了“心灵社会”理念，通过五个角色（外行人、简化者、医学专家、语言澄清者和冗余检查者）的交互循环，逐步提升简化效果，同时保持内容的准确性和复杂性。评估显示，我们的框架在可读性和内容保留方面优于现有方法。

> Medical text simplification is crucial for making complex biomedical literature more accessible to non-experts. Traditional methods struggle with the specialized terms and jargon of medical texts, lacking the flexibility to adapt the simplification process dynamically. In contrast, recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) present unique opportunities by offering enhanced control over text simplification through iterative refinement and collaboration between specialized agents. In this work, we introduce the Society of Medical Simplifiers, a novel LLM-based framework inspired by the "Society of Mind" (SOM) philosophy. Our approach leverages the strengths of LLMs by assigning five distinct roles, i.e., Layperson, Simplifier, Medical Expert, Language Clarifier, and Redundancy Checker, organized into interaction loops. This structure allows the agents to progressively improve text simplification while maintaining the complexity and accuracy of the original content. Evaluations on the Cochrane text simplification dataset demonstrate that our framework is on par with or outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior readability and content preservation through controlled simplification processes.
