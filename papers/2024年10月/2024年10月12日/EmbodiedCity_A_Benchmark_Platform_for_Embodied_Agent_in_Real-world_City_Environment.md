> EmbodiedCity: A Benchmark Platform for Embodied Agent in Real-world City Environment

# 摘要

> 具身人工智能强调代理的身体在产生类人行为中的作用。近期研究致力于构建具备感知、规划和行动能力的机器学习模型，以实现与世界的实时互动。然而，多数研究局限于室内环境，如房间导航或设备操作，对开放世界场景的探索有限。本文针对这一问题，构建了一个在真实城市环境中评估具身智能的基准平台。我们首先创建了一个基于真实城市元素的高度逼真的3D模拟环境，结合历史数据和模拟算法，进行高保真的行人和车辆流量模拟。此外，设计了一套涵盖不同具身AI能力的评估任务，并提供完整的输入输出接口，使具身代理能够根据任务要求和环境观察做出决策并获得性能评估。这不仅提升了具身智能的能力，还在现实世界中具有更高的实用价值，支持更多人造通用智能的潜在应用。基于此平台，我们评估了一些流行的大型语言模型在不同维度和难度下的具身智能能力。

> Embodied artificial intelligence emphasizes the role of an agent's body in generating human-like behaviors. The recent efforts on EmbodiedAI pay a lot of attention to building up machine learning models to possess perceiving, planning, and acting abilities, thereby enabling real-time interaction with the world. However, most works focus on bounded indoor environments, such as navigation in a room or manipulating a device, with limited exploration of embodying the agents in open-world scenarios. That is, embodied intelligence in the open and outdoor environment is less explored, for which one potential reason is the lack of high-quality simulators, benchmarks, and datasets. To address it, in this paper, we construct a benchmark platform for embodied intelligence evaluation in real-world city environments. Specifically, we first construct a highly realistic 3D simulation environment based on the real buildings, roads, and other elements in a real city. In this environment, we combine historically collected data and simulation algorithms to conduct simulations of pedestrian and vehicle flows with high fidelity. Further, we designed a set of evaluation tasks covering different EmbodiedAI abilities. Moreover, we provide a complete set of input and output interfaces for access, enabling embodied agents to easily take task requirements and current environmental observations as input and then make decisions and obtain performance evaluations. On the one hand, it expands the capability of existing embodied intelligence to higher levels. On the other hand, it has a higher practical value in the real world and can support more potential applications for artificial general intelligence. Based on this platform, we evaluate some popular large language models for embodied intelligence capabilities of different dimensions and difficulties.
