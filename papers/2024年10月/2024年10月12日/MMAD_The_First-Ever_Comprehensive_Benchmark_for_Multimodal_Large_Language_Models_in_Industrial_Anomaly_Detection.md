> MMAD: The First-Ever Comprehensive Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models in Industrial Anomaly Detection

# 摘要

> 多模态大型语言模型 (MLLMs) 在工业检测领域展现出更新应用范式的巨大潜力，但其工业异常检测能力尚未得到系统研究。为此，我们推出了 MMAD，首个全方位的工业异常检测 MLLMs 基准。通过定义七个关键子任务，我们生成了包含 39,672 个问题的 MMAD 数据集，涵盖 8,366 张工业图像。评估结果显示，商业模型 GPT-4o 的平均准确率为 74.9%，但仍未满足工业要求。分析表明，MLLMs 在处理工业异常和缺陷问题方面仍有显著提升空间。我们探索了两种无需训练的性能提升策略，为未来研究指明了方向。

> In the field of industrial inspection, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have a high potential to renew the paradigms in practical applications due to their robust language capabilities and generalization abilities. However, despite their impressive problem-solving skills in many domains, MLLMs' ability in industrial anomaly detection has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we present MMAD, the first-ever full-spectrum MLLMs benchmark in industrial Anomaly Detection. We defined seven key subtasks of MLLMs in industrial inspection and designed a novel pipeline to generate the MMAD dataset with 39,672 questions for 8,366 industrial images. With MMAD, we have conducted a comprehensive, quantitative evaluation of various state-of-the-art MLLMs. The commercial models performed the best, with the average accuracy of GPT-4o models reaching 74.9%. However, this result falls far short of industrial requirements. Our analysis reveals that current MLLMs still have significant room for improvement in answering questions related to industrial anomalies and defects. We further explore two training-free performance enhancement strategies to help models improve in industrial scenarios, highlighting their promising potential for future research.
