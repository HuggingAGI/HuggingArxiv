> Quebec Automobile Insurance Question-Answering With Retrieval-Augmented Generation

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型 (LLM) 在多种任务中表现卓越，尤其是通过 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) 架构提升法律问答性能（Nuruzzaman 和 Hussain, 2020; Louis 等人, 2024）。然而，在保险问答领域，应用仍显不足。本文引入魁北克汽车保险专家参考语料库及 82 个外行汽车保险问题专家答案。我们利用这些语料库，自动与手动评估 GPT4-o，发现使用专家参考语料库的回答在评估指标上更优。但研究也揭示，LLM 问答在关键领域的大规模应用中存在 5% 至 13% 的错误率，可能导致客户误解。

> Large Language Models (LLMs) perform outstandingly in various downstream tasks, and the use of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture has been shown to improve performance for legal question answering (Nuruzzaman and Hussain, 2020; Louis et al., 2024). However, there are limited applications in insurance questions-answering, a specific type of legal document. This paper introduces two corpora: the Quebec Automobile Insurance Expertise Reference Corpus and a set of 82 Expert Answers to Layperson Automobile Insurance Questions. Our study leverages both corpora to automatically and manually assess a GPT4-o, a state-of-the-art LLM, to answer Quebec automobile insurance questions. Our results demonstrate that, on average, using our expertise reference corpus generates better responses on both automatic and manual evaluation metrics. However, they also highlight that LLM QA is unreliable enough for mass utilization in critical areas. Indeed, our results show that between 5% to 13% of answered questions include a false statement that could lead to customer misunderstanding.
