> SouLLMate: An Adaptive LLM-Driven System for Advanced Mental Health Support and Assessment, Based on a Systematic Application Survey

# 摘要

> 心理健康问题严重影响日常生活，但许多人仍无法通过现有在线资源获得帮助。本研究旨在利用前沿AI技术，提供无污名、个性化且实时的精神健康支持。主要贡献包括：（1）广泛调查现有心理健康支持方法，识别常见功能与未满足需求。（2）推出SouLLMate系统，整合LLM、RAG等技术，提供自杀风险检测等高级功能。（3）创新评估方法，利用真实数据评估初步评估与自杀风险。（4）提出KIS与PQS策略，通过上下文调整与语义评估提升模型性能。本研究有望提升全球心理健康护理的可及性与效果。

> Mental health issues significantly impact individuals' daily lives, yet many do not receive the help they need even with available online resources. This study aims to provide accessible, stigma-free, personalized, and real-time mental health support through cutting-edge AI technologies. It makes the following contributions: (1) Conducting an extensive survey of recent mental health support methods to identify prevalent functionalities and unmet needs. (2) Introducing SouLLMate, an adaptive LLM-driven system that integrates LLM technologies, Chain, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), prompt engineering, and domain knowledge. This system offers advanced features such as Suicide Risk Detection and Proactive Guidance Dialogue, and utilizes RAG for personalized profile uploads and Conversational Information Extraction. (3) Developing novel evaluation approaches to assess preliminary assessments and suicide risk detection, utilizing annotated real-life interview data and professionally labeled datasets indicating suicide tendencies. (4) Proposing Key Indicator Summarization (KIS) and Proactive Questioning Strategy (PQS) methods to enhance model performance and usability through context-sensitive response adjustments and semantic coherence evaluations. This study contributes to advancing mental health support technologies, potentially improving the accessibility and effectiveness of mental health care globally.
