# 摘要

> 当前的聊天 AI 助手多为被动响应，仅在用户提问时才行动。然而，这些系统主动协助任务的潜力巨大，能实现更自然的交互。本研究聚焦于大型语言模型驱动的主动 AI 助手的设计与实现。首先，我们概述了构建此类助手的核心设计要点。作为案例，我们设计了一款主动编程助手，能自动提供建议并融入代码。编程环境为助手提供了共享空间，使其建议更精准。通过随机实验，我们评估了不同设计对编程效率和用户体验的影响。结果显示，主动聊天助手显著提升了编码效率，并揭示了影响其效能的关键因素。

> While current chat-based AI assistants primarily operate reactively, responding only when prompted by users, there is significant potential for these systems to proactively assist in tasks without explicit invocation, enabling a mixed-initiative interaction. This work explores the design and implementation of proactive AI assistants powered by large language models. We first outline the key design considerations for building effective proactive assistants. As a case study, we propose a proactive chat-based programming assistant that automatically provides suggestions and facilitates their integration into the programmer's code. The programming context provides a shared workspace enabling the assistant to offer more relevant suggestions. We conducted a randomized experimental study examining the impact of various design elements of the proactive assistant on programmer productivity and user experience. Our findings reveal significant benefits of incorporating proactive chat assistants into coding environments and uncover important nuances that influence their usage and effectiveness.
