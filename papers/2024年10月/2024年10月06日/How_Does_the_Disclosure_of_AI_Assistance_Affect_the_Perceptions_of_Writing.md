> How Does the Disclosure of AI Assistance Affect the Perceptions of Writing?

# 摘要

> 生成式AI技术的进步，如大型语言模型，推动了AI在写作中的应用，开启了人机共创的新时代。本文通过实验探讨了披露AI辅助信息如何影响读者对作品的评价。研究发现，特别是当AI参与内容生成时，披露其辅助会降低作品的平均质量评分，并增加评价的差异性。此外，个人的写作自信和AI助手的熟悉度也会影响评价结果。最后，披露AI使用情况还可能导致顶级作品中AI辅助创作的比例下降。

> Recent advances in generative AI technologies like large language models have boosted the incorporation of AI assistance in writing workflows, leading to the rise of a new paradigm of human-AI co-creation in writing. To understand how people perceive writings that are produced under this paradigm, in this paper, we conduct an experimental study to understand whether and how the disclosure of the level and type of AI assistance in the writing process would affect people's perceptions of the writing on various aspects, including their evaluation on the quality of the writing and their ranking of different writings. Our results suggest that disclosing the AI assistance in the writing process, especially if AI has provided assistance in generating new content, decreases the average quality ratings for both argumentative essays and creative stories. This decrease in the average quality ratings often comes with an increased level of variations in different individuals' quality evaluations of the same writing. Indeed, factors such as an individual's writing confidence and familiarity with AI writing assistants are shown to moderate the impact of AI assistance disclosure on their writing quality evaluations. We also find that disclosing the use of AI assistance may significantly reduce the proportion of writings produced with AI's content generation assistance among the top-ranked writings.
