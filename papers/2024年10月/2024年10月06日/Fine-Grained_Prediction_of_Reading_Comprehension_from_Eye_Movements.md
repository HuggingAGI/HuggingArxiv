> Fine-Grained Prediction of Reading Comprehension from Eye Movements

# 摘要

> 我们探讨了一个长期存在的问题：阅读时的眼球运动能否反映人类的阅读理解能力？通过大规模眼动追踪数据，我们专注于预测单个问题在段落层面的阅读理解，这是一个细粒度且未被充分研究的任务。我们采用了三种新型多模态语言模型和多种现有模型来解决这一挑战。在普通阅读和信息搜索两种模式下，我们评估了模型对新文本和新参与者的泛化能力。结果显示，尽管任务艰巨，眼球运动确实蕴含着预测阅读理解的有用信息。相关代码和数据将公开共享。

> Can human reading comprehension be assessed from eye movements in reading? In this work, we address this longstanding question using large-scale eyetracking data over textual materials that are geared towards behavioral analyses of reading comprehension. We focus on a fine-grained and largely unaddressed task of predicting reading comprehension from eye movements at the level of a single question over a passage. We tackle this task using three new multimodal language models, as well as a battery of prior models from the literature. We evaluate the models' ability to generalize to new textual items, new participants, and the combination of both, in two different reading regimes, ordinary reading and information seeking. The evaluations suggest that although the task is highly challenging, eye movements contain useful signals for fine-grained prediction of reading comprehension. Code and data will be made publicly available.
