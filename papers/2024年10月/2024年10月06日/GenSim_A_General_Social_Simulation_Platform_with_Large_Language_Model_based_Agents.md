# 摘要

> 随着 LLM 的迅猛发展，基于 LLM 代理模拟人类社会行为的研究近年来取得了显著进展。然而，现有研究多聚焦于特定场景，且在模拟错误时缺乏适应性。为此，我们推出了 \textit{GenSim} 平台，该平台通过抽象通用功能简化模拟，支持十万代理模拟大规模人群，并整合错误纠正机制，确保模拟的可靠性和长期性。通过评估模拟效率和错误纠正效果，GenSim 展现了其在社会科学领域的巨大潜力，标志着向通用、大规模、可纠正社会模拟平台迈出的重要一步。

> With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), recent years have witnessed many promising studies on leveraging LLM-based agents to simulate human social behavior. While prior work has demonstrated significant potential across various domains, much of it has focused on specific scenarios involving a limited number of agents and has lacked the ability to adapt when errors occur during simulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel LLM-agent-based simulation platform called \textit{GenSim}, which: (1) \textbf{Abstracts a set of general functions} to simplify the simulation of customized social scenarios; (2) \textbf{Supports one hundred thousand agents} to better simulate large-scale populations in real-world contexts; (3) \textbf{Incorporates error-correction mechanisms} to ensure more reliable and long-term simulations. To evaluate our platform, we assess both the efficiency of large-scale agent simulations and the effectiveness of the error-correction mechanisms. To our knowledge, GenSim represents an initial step toward a general, large-scale, and correctable social simulation platform based on LLM agents, promising to further advance the field of social science.
