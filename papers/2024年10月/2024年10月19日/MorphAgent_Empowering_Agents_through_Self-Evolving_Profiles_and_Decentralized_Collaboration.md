# 摘要

> MorphAgent 是一种基于 LLM 的去中心化多代理协作框架，它让代理能够动态调整角色和能力，从而更好地应对不断变化的挑战。通过自我演化的代理配置文件和三个关键指标的优化，MorphAgent 在保持团队互补性的同时，提升了每个代理的专业水平。实验证明，MorphAgent 在任务性能和适应性方面超越了传统 MAS，为更强大的多代理协作系统奠定了基础。代码即将在 \url{https://github.com/LINs-lab/learn2collaborate} 公开。

> Large Language Model (LLM) based multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown promise in tackling complex tasks, but often rely on predefined roles and centralized coordination, limiting their adaptability to evolving challenges. This paper introduces MorphAgent, a novel framework for decentralized multi-agent collaboration that enables agents to dynamically evolve their roles and capabilities. Our approach employs self-evolving agent profiles, optimized through three key metrics, guiding agents in refining their individual expertise while maintaining complementary team dynamics. MorphAgent implements a two-phase process: a warm-up phase for initial profile optimization, followed by a task execution phase where agents continuously adapt their roles based on task feedback. Our experimental results show that MorphAgent outperforms traditional static-role MAS in terms of task performance and adaptability to changing requirements, paving the way for more robust and versatile multi-agent collaborative systems. Our code will be publicly available at \url{https://github.com/LINs-lab/learn2collaborate}.
