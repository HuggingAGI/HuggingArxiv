> MedGo: A Chinese Medical Large Language Model

# 摘要

> 大型模型在人工智能领域是热门研究主题。借助其生成能力，有望提升医疗服务的水平与质量。鉴于当下大型语言模型在医疗应用中常存在准确性欠佳、能力狭窄的局限，本文推出了中文医疗大型语言模型 MedGo。MedGo 通过高质量的无监督医疗数据、有监督数据及偏好对齐数据的组合加以训练，旨在增强其在医疗任务中的通用性和精准度。该模型经由公共的 CBLUE 基准和人工构建的数据集 ClinicalQA 进行评估。结果显示，MedGo 在各类中文医疗信息处理任务中表现出色，在 CBLUE 评估中位列第一。另外，在我们构建的数据集 ClinicalQA 中，MedGo 超越了其基础模型 Qwen2，凸显出其在优化自动医疗问答和临床决策支持方面的潜力。这些实验结果表明，MedGo 在医疗领域具备强大的信息处理能力。当下，我们已在上海东方医院成功部署了 MedGo。

> Large models are a hot research topic in the field of artificial intelligence. Leveraging their generative capabilities has the potential to enhance the level and quality of medical services. In response to the limitations of current large language models, which often struggle with accuracy and have narrow capabilities in medical applications, this paper presents a Chinese medical large language model, MedGo. MedGo was trained using a combination of high quality unsupervised medical data, supervised data, and preference alignment data, aimed at enhancing both its versatility and precision in medical tasks. The model was evaluated through the public CBLUE benchmark and a manually constructed dataset ClinicalQA. The results demonstrate that MedGo achieved promising performance across various Chinese medical information processing tasks, achieved the first place in the CBLUE evaluation. Additionally, on our constructed dataset ClinicalQA, MedGo outperformed its base model Qwen2, highlighting its potential to improve both automated medical question answering and clinical decision support. These experimental results demonstrate that MedGo possesses strong information processing capabilities in the medical field. At present, we have successfully deployed MedGo at Shanghai East Hospital.
