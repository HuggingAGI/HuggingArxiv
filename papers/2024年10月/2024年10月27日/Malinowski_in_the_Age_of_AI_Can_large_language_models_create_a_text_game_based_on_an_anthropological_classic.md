> Malinowski in the Age of AI: Can large language models create a text game based on an anthropological classic?

# 摘要

> 近期，诸如 ChatGPT 和 GPT-4 这类大型语言模型（LLMs）在众多任务中，如文本总结和辅助编码等，展现出了卓越的能力。科学研究显示，这些模型还能玩文字冒险游戏。本研究旨在探索 LLMs 能否依据人类学经典自主创建文本游戏，并评估其在知识传播方面的成效。为达此目的，研究邀请人类学家参与讨论，收集他们对于一款人类学主题游戏的期望和设计建议。遵循既定的“设计思维”这一 HCI 原则，通过迭代过程，优化了创作这些游戏的提示和概念框架。借助 GPT3.5，围绕社会人类学家 Bronislaw Malinowski 的经典人类学著作《西太平洋的航海者》（1922 年），创建了三款游戏原型。之后，邀请资深人类学家试玩并进行评估，根据他们的反馈改进游戏设计。测试取得了可喜成果，但也暴露出关键问题：模型在提供深入的主题理解时存在困难，易出现错误信息，长时间游戏后回应趋于单调，且难以提供详细的人物传记信息。尽管有这些局限，研究结果为人工智能、机器学习、LLMs、民族志、人类学和人机交互的交叉领域开辟了新的研究方向。

> Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 have shown remarkable abilities in a wide range of tasks such as summarizing texts and assisting in coding. Scientific research has demonstrated that these models can also play text-adventure games. This study aims to explore whether LLMs can autonomously create text-based games based on anthropological classics, evaluating also their effectiveness in communicating knowledge. To achieve this, the study engaged anthropologists in discussions to gather their expectations and design inputs for an anthropologically themed game. Through iterative processes following the established HCI principle of 'design thinking', the prompts and the conceptual framework for crafting these games were refined. Leveraging GPT3.5, the study created three prototypes of games centered around the seminal anthropological work of the social anthropologist's Bronislaw Malinowski's "Argonauts of the Western Pacific" (1922). Subsequently, evaluations were conducted by inviting senior anthropologists to playtest these games, and based on their inputs, the game designs were refined. The tests revealed promising outcomes but also highlighted key challenges: the models encountered difficulties in providing in-depth thematic understandings, showed suspectibility to misinformation, tended towards monotonic responses after an extended period of play, and struggled to offer detailed biographical information. Despite these limitations, the study's findings open up new research avenues at the crossroads of artificial intelligence, machine learning, LLMs, ethnography, anthropology and human-computer interaction.
