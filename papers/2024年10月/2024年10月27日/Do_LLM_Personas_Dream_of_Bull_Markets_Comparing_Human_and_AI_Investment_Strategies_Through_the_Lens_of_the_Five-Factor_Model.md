> Do LLM Personas Dream of Bull Markets? Comparing Human and AI Investment Strategies Through the Lens of the Five-Factor Model

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）已展现出能够拥有个性并像人类一样行事的能力。众多研究探究了个性在诸如投资态度或创造性决策等不太显著的领域所产生的行为影响。在此项研究中，我们探究了具有特定大五人格特征的LLM角色是否会与具有相同人格特质的人类一样执行投资任务。我们通过模拟投资任务来判定这些结果能否推广至实际行为。在这一模拟环境下，我们的成果显示，这些角色在所有评估类别中均产生了有意义的行为差异，且这些行为通常与人类研究得出的预期相符。我们发现，LLMs能够在学习风格、冲动性和风险偏好这三个方面将特质推广为预期行为，而环境态度则无法被准确呈现。另外，我们表明，相较于调查环境，LLMs在模拟环境中产生的行为更能体现人类行为。

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to adopt a personality and behave in a human-like manner. There is a large body of research that investigates the behavioural impacts of personality in less obvious areas such as investment attitudes or creative decision making. In this study, we investigated whether an LLM persona with a specific Big Five personality profile would perform an investment task similarly to a human with the same personality traits. We used a simulated investment task to determine if these results could be generalised into actual behaviours. In this simulated environment, our results show these personas produced meaningful behavioural differences in all assessed categories, with these behaviours generally being consistent with expectations derived from human research. We found that LLMs are able to generalise traits into expected behaviours in three areas: learning style, impulsivity and risk appetite while environmental attitudes could not be accurately represented. In addition, we showed that LLMs produce behaviour that is more reflective of human behaviour in a simulation environment compared to a survey environment.
