> A Survey on Point-of-Interest Recommendation: Models, Architectures, and Security

# 摘要

> 智能手机和基于位置的社交网络的普及，带来了海量的时空数据，为提升兴趣点（POI）推荐系统提供了巨大机遇。这些先进的POI系统不仅丰富了用户体验，还优化了数字环境中的决策过程。然而，现有研究多聚焦于传统方法，鲜少涉及前沿技术与安全考量。为此，我们的调查全面回顾了POI推荐系统的最新进展，涵盖模型、架构及安全层面。我们详细分析了从传统模型向大型语言模型等先进技术的演进，并探讨了从集中式到去中心化及联邦学习系统的架构变革，强调了可扩展性与隐私的提升。此外，我们深入探讨了安全问题，评估了潜在风险与隐私保护策略。我们的分类法清晰呈现了当前POI推荐系统的全貌，并指出了未来研究的方向。

> The widespread adoption of smartphones and Location-Based Social Networks has led to a massive influx of spatio-temporal data, creating unparalleled opportunities for enhancing Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation systems. These advanced POI systems are crucial for enriching user experiences, enabling personalized interactions, and optimizing decision-making processes in the digital landscape. However, existing surveys tend to focus on traditional approaches and few of them delve into cutting-edge developments, emerging architectures, as well as security considerations in POI recommendations. To address this gap, our survey stands out by offering a comprehensive, up-to-date review of POI recommendation systems, covering advancements in models, architectures, and security aspects. We systematically examine the transition from traditional models to advanced techniques such as large language models. Additionally, we explore the architectural evolution from centralized to decentralized and federated learning systems, highlighting the improvements in scalability and privacy. Furthermore, we address the increasing importance of security, examining potential vulnerabilities and privacy-preserving approaches. Our taxonomy provides a structured overview of the current state of POI recommendation, while we also identify promising directions for future research in this rapidly advancing field.
