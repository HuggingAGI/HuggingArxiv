# 摘要

> 二阶优化方法通过利用曲率信息，在训练深度神经网络时能更快收敛。然而，传统二阶技术因大矩阵求逆和高内存需求而计算成本高昂。尽管自适应信任区域方法有所改进，但其保守估计关键参数（如Hessian的Lipschitz常数）常导致次优结果。本文提出SecondOrderAdaptiveAdam (SOAA)，一种新型优化算法，通过对角表示近似Fisher信息矩阵，将计算复杂度从 \(O(n^{2})\) 降至 \(O(n)\)，适用于大规模深度学习模型，包括LLM。SOAA还集成了自适应信任区域机制，动态调整信任区域大小，确保稳健收敛和计算效率。实证显示，在相同计算约束下，SOAA比一阶优化器（如Adam）收敛更快更稳定。但Fisher信息矩阵的对角近似可能影响高阶梯度相互作用的捕捉，提示未来改进方向。

> Second-order optimization methods offer notable advantages in training deep neural networks by utilizing curvature information to achieve faster convergence. However, traditional second-order techniques are computationally prohibitive, primarily due to the large matrix inversions and high memory demands they require. While adaptive trust-region methods have been developed to mitigate these issues, their performance is often hindered by conservative estimates of key parameters, such as the Lipschitz constant of the Hessian, resulting in suboptimal outcomes. In this paper, we introduce SecondOrderAdaptiveAdam (SOAA), a novel optimization algorithm designed to overcome these limitations. SOAA approximates the Fisher information matrix using a diagonal representation, reducing computational complexity from \(O(n^{2})\) to \(O(n)\), thereby making it suitable for large-scale deep learning models, including large language models (LLMs). Additionally, the algorithm integrates an adaptive trust-region mechanism that dynamically adjusts the trust region size based on observed loss reduction, ensuring both robust convergence and computational efficiency. We empirically demonstrate that SOAA achieves faster and more stable convergence compared to first-order optimizers, such as Adam, under similar computational constraints. However, the diagonal approximation of the Fisher information matrix may be less effective in capturing higher-order interactions between gradients, suggesting potential areas for further refinement and future research.
