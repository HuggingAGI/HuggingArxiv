> Preparing for Super-Reactivity: Early Fault-Detection in the Development of Exceedingly Complex Reactive Systems

# 摘要

> 我们提出“超级反应系统”这一概念，用以描述那些结构复杂、不断演化且与外界紧密关联的反应系统。在开发初期识别这些系统中的潜在故障，对于保障人类安全、环境保护、社会稳定和经济繁荣至关重要。然而，系统复杂性和技术细节的缺失，使得这一过程充满挑战。为此，我们设计了一套模型与工具架构，旨在克服这些障碍，实现早期模拟、系统分析、故障检测与处理。这一方法依托于大型语言模型及其AI工具的推理与抽象能力，通过以下两点实现：(i) 对自然语言描述的模型元素进行延迟、即时解析；(ii) 提前捕捉看似无关需求间的隐性关联。

> We introduce the term Super-Reactive Systems to refer to reactive systems whose construction and behavior are complex, constantly changing and evolving, and heavily interwoven with other systems and the physical world. Finding hidden faults in such systems early in planning and development is critical for human safety, the environment, society and the economy. However, the complexity of the system and its interactions and the absence of adequate technical details pose a great obstacle. We propose an architecture for models and tools to overcome such barriers and enable simulation, systematic analysis, and fault detection and handling, early in the development of super-reactive systems. The approach is facilitated by the inference and abstraction capabilities and the power and knowledge afforded by large language models and associated AI tools. It is based on: (i) deferred, just-in-time interpretation of model elements that are stored in natural language form, and (ii) early capture of tacit interdependencies among seemingly orthogonal requirements.
