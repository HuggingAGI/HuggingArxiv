# 摘要

> 我们研究了基于规则系统的复杂性如何影响训练来预测这些规则的模型的能力，从而探索人工智能系统中智能行为的涌现。我们专注于初等元胞自动机（ECA），这是一种简单但强大的单维系统，能够生成从简单到高度复杂的行为。通过在不同ECA上训练大型语言模型（LLM），我们评估了规则复杂性与LLM智能之间的关系，这体现在下游任务中的表现。研究发现，复杂性更高的规则使模型展现出更大的智能，这在推理和国际象棋走子预测任务中得到了验证。均匀、周期性及高度混沌的系统表现较差，突显了有利于智能的复杂性最佳点。我们推测，智能源于预测复杂性的能力，而创造智能可能只需接触复杂性。

> We explore the emergence of intelligent behavior in artificial systems by investigating how the complexity of rule-based systems influences the capabilities of models trained to predict these rules. Our study focuses on elementary cellular automata (ECA), simple yet powerful one-dimensional systems that generate behaviors ranging from trivial to highly complex. By training distinct Large Language Models (LLMs) on different ECAs, we evaluated the relationship between the complexity of the rules' behavior and the intelligence exhibited by the LLMs, as reflected in their performance on downstream tasks. Our findings reveal that rules with higher complexity lead to models exhibiting greater intelligence, as demonstrated by their performance on reasoning and chess move prediction tasks. Both uniform and periodic systems, and often also highly chaotic systems, resulted in poorer downstream performance, highlighting a sweet spot of complexity conducive to intelligence. We conjecture that intelligence arises from the ability to predict complexity and that creating intelligence may require only exposure to complexity.
