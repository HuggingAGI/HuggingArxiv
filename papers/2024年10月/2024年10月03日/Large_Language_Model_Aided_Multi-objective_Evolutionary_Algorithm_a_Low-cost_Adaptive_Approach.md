> Large Language Model Aided Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm: a Low-cost Adaptive Approach

# 摘要

> 多目标优化在实际应用中普遍存在，多目标进化算法 (MOEA) 是解决此类问题的有效手段。然而，其随机性有时阻碍了快速全局收敛，且遗传算子的设计需复杂的手动调优。为此，本研究提出一种新框架，结合大型语言模型 (LLM) 与传统进化算法，提升搜索与泛化能力。我们通过自适应与混合机制，将 LLM 融入 MOEA，加速收敛。具体而言，利用辅助评估函数和自动提示构建，灵活调整 LLM 使用，生成高质量解，再经遗传算子优化。同时，混合机制力求最小化与 LLM 的交互成本。

> Multi-objective optimization is a common problem in practical applications, and multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is considered as one of the effective methods to solve these problems. However, their randomness sometimes prevents algorithms from rapidly converging to global optimization, and the design of their genetic operators often requires complicated manual tuning. To overcome this challenge, this study proposes a new framework that combines a large language model (LLM) with traditional evolutionary algorithms to enhance the algorithm's search capability and generalization performance.In our framework, we employ adaptive and hybrid mechanisms to integrate the LLM with the MOEA, thereby accelerating algorithmic convergence. Specifically, we leverage an auxiliary evaluation function and automated prompt construction within the adaptive mechanism to flexibly adjust the utilization of the LLM, generating high-quality solutions that are further refined and optimized through genetic operators.Concurrently, the hybrid mechanism aims to minimize interaction costs with the LLM as much as possible.
