# 摘要

> 精准推荐产品一直是研究热点。本研究创新性地提出了一种结合文本和图像的多模态服装推荐方法，借助预训练大模型深入挖掘用户与产品的潜在联系。同时，通过变分编码器解决推荐系统冷启动难题。大量实验证明，该方法在性能上显著优于传统推荐系统，为推荐系统的全面优化提供了宝贵指导。

> Accurately recommending products has long been a subject requiring in-depth research. This study proposes a multimodal paradigm for clothing recommendations. Specifically, it designs a multimodal analysis method that integrates clothing description texts and images, utilizing a pre-trained large language model to deeply explore the hidden meanings of users and products. Additionally, a variational encoder is employed to learn the relationship between user information and products to address the cold start problem in recommendation systems. This study also validates the significant performance advantages of this method over various recommendation system methods through extensive ablation experiments, providing crucial practical guidance for the comprehensive optimization of recommendation systems.
