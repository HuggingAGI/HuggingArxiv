# 摘要

> 基于 Transformer 架构的大型语言模型 (LLM) 在众多任务中表现出色，但针对特定任务的微调因其庞大参数而资源消耗巨大。本文探讨了 LLM 微调中的两个关键现象，特别聚焦于注意力机制：(1) 优化 $\mathbf{W}_v$ 矩阵比 $\mathbf{W}_k$ 矩阵更能提升性能，仅微调 $\mathbf{W}_q$ 和 $\mathbf{W}_v$ 矩阵既高效又有效，甚至优于全矩阵微调。(2) 为各矩阵设定不同学习率至关重要，特别是 $\mathbf{W}_v$ 的高学习率能加速收敛。尽管理论分析尚浅，我们从泛化和优化两方面进行了探讨：(i) 仅微调 $\mathbf{W}_q$ 和 $\mathbf{W}_v$ 能提升泛化能力并节省内存；(ii) 注意力机制的特征学习在不同学习率下更为高效。基于此，我们提出了一种提升微调效率的新策略。实验证实了其有效性，为 LLM 微调中的轻量级算法优化提供了理论支持。

> Large Language Models (LLMs), built on Transformer architectures, exhibit remarkable generalization across a wide range of tasks. However, fine-tuning these models for specific tasks remains resource-intensive due to their extensive parameterization. In this paper, we investigate two remarkable phenomena observed during the fine-tuning of LLMs, particularly focusing on the attention mechanism: (1) Different Impact, optimizing the $\mathbf{W}_v$ matrix significantly improves performance over optimizing the $\mathbf{W}_k$ matrix. Fine-tuning only the $\mathbf{W}_q$ and $\mathbf{W}_v$ matrices is computationally efficient, delivering results that are comparable to, or even better than, fine-tuning all three matrices $\mathbf{W}_q$, $\mathbf{W}_k$, and $\mathbf{W}_v$. (2) Efficient Convergence, employing distinct learning rates for these matrices is crucial for optimal performance, with a higher learning rate for the $\mathbf{W}_v$ matrix expediting convergence. However, theoretical analyses of these phenomena are still relatively limited. We present a theoretical analysis of these phenomena from two perspectives: (i) Generalization, where we demonstrate that fine-tuning only $\mathbf{W}_q$ and $\mathbf{W}_v$ improves generalization bounds, enhances memory efficiency, and (ii) Optimization, where we emphasize that the feature learning of the attention mechanism is efficient, particularly when using distinct learning rates for the matrices, which leads to more effective fine-tuning. Building on these insights, we propose a new strategy that improves fine-tuning efficiency in terms of both storage and time. Experimental results on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of this approach, supporting our theoretical findings. Our analysis lays the theoretical groundwork for configuring and improving lightweight algorithms in LLMs fine-tuning.
