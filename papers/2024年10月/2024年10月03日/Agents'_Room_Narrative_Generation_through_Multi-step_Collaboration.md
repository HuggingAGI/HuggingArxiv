> Agents' Room: Narrative Generation through Multi-step Collaboration

# 摘要

> 创作引人入胜的小说涉及构建情节、塑造角色和运用语言等多方面技巧。尽管大型语言模型 (LLM) 在故事创作上有所突破，但其对复杂提示的依赖限制了应用。为此，我们推出了 Agents' Room 框架，借鉴叙事理论，将写作任务分解为专业代理处理的子任务。我们还创建了 Tell Me A Story 数据集和评估框架，专门用于长篇叙事评估。实验表明，Agents' Room 通过协作与专业化，将复杂写作任务分解，生成的故事更受专家青睐。我们通过自动化和人工评估，全面分析了生成效果。

> Writing compelling fiction is a multifaceted process combining elements such as crafting a plot, developing interesting characters, and using evocative language. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for story writing, they currently rely heavily on intricate prompting, which limits their use. We propose Agents' Room, a generation framework inspired by narrative theory, that decomposes narrative writing into subtasks tackled by specialized agents. To illustrate our method, we introduce Tell Me A Story, a high-quality dataset of complex writing prompts and human-written stories, and a novel evaluation framework designed specifically for assessing long narratives. We show that Agents' Room generates stories that are preferred by expert evaluators over those produced by baseline systems by leveraging collaboration and specialization to decompose the complex story writing task into tractable components. We provide extensive analysis with automated and human-based metrics of the generated output.
