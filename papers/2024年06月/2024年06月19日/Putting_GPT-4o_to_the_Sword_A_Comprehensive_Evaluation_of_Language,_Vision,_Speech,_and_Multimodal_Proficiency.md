> Putting GPT-4o to the Sword: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Language, Vision, Speech, and Multimodal Proficiency

# 摘要

> 随着 LLM 的持续进步，全面评估其在多领域应用中的能力显得尤为重要。本研究对 GPT-4o 的语言、视觉、语音及多模态能力进行了全面测试。通过标准化考试、推理任务和翻译评估，我们检验了其语言处理能力；图像分类、物体识别及口音分类则测试了其视觉和语音技能；多模态评估则聚焦于模型整合视觉与语言信息的能力。研究显示，GPT-4o 在语言和推理任务中表现出色，尤其在少量样本学习任务中效率高且准确。相较于前代，GPT-4o 在多模态任务上也有显著提升。但面对复杂模糊的输入，模型在音频和视觉处理上仍显不足。本文呼吁建立更全面的评估体系，包括人类判断参与的定性分析和错误分析，并建议未来研究应扩展数据集、探索基于提示的评估方法，以及优化少量学习技术，以提升模型在实际应用中的表现。

> As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, evaluating their comprehensive capabilities becomes significant for their application in various fields. This research study comprehensively evaluates the language, vision, speech, and multimodal capabilities of GPT-4o. The study employs standardized exam questions, reasoning tasks, and translation assessments to assess the model's language capability. Additionally, GPT-4o's vision and speech capabilities are tested through image classification and object recognition tasks, as well as accent classification. The multimodal evaluation assesses the model's performance in integrating visual and linguistic data. Our findings reveal that GPT-4o demonstrates high accuracy and efficiency across multiple domains in language and reasoning capabilities, excelling in tasks that require few-shot learning. GPT-4o also provides notable improvements in multimodal tasks compared to its predecessors. However, the model shows variability and faces limitations in handling complex and ambiguous inputs, particularly in audio and vision capabilities. This paper highlights the need for more comprehensive benchmarks and robust evaluation frameworks, encompassing qualitative assessments involving human judgment as well as error analysis. Future work should focus on expanding datasets, investigating prompt-based assessment, and enhancing few-shot learning techniques to test the model's practical applicability and performance in real-world scenarios.
