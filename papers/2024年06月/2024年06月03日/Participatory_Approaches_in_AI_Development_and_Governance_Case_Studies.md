# 摘要

> 本文是探讨AI开发与部署中参与式方法价值的系列文章的第二篇。首篇论文已为采用参与式方法提供了原则性与实用性依据。实用之处在于，它能通过提供更细致的信息提升算法整体质量；原则性则体现在，它赋予受算法影响者发声机会，并通过参与建立对AI系统的信任与接受。所谓参与式方法，即在AI系统全生命周期中，让各类利益相关者参与决策。尽管有上述理由，实际实施仍关键取决于如何识别利益相关者、获取何种信息及如何整合。本文将在两个领域验证这些初步结论：一是法律秩序维护中使用的面部识别技术，二是医疗保健领域的大型语言模型。选择这两个领域，一是因为面部识别技术作为成熟且影响记录详尽的AI分支，为展示PAI适应现有领域提供了稳定平台，尤其是在过去颇具争议的领域；二是医疗保健中的LLMs相对较少探索，有助于展示如何将PAI原则融入新兴技术，确保创新始终与患者福利一致。

> This paper forms the second of a two-part series on the value of a participatory approach to AI development and deployment. The first paper had crafted a principled, as well as pragmatic, justification for deploying participatory methods in these two exercises (that is, development and deployment of AI). The pragmatic justification is that it improves the quality of the overall algorithm by providing more granular and minute information. The more principled justification is that it offers a voice to those who are going to be affected by the deployment of the algorithm, and through engagement attempts to build trust and buy-in for an AI system. By a participatory approach, we mean including various stakeholders (defined a certain way) in the actual decision making process through the life cycle of an AI system. Despite the justifications offered above, actual implementation depends crucially on how stakeholders in the entire process are identified, what information is elicited from them, and how it is incorporated. This paper will test these preliminary conclusions in two sectors, the use of facial recognition technology in the upkeep of law and order and the use of large language models in the healthcare sector. These sectors have been chosen for two primary reasons. Since Facial Recognition Technologies are a branch of AI solutions that are well-researched and the impact of which is well documented, it provides an established space to illustrate the various aspects of adapting PAI to an existing domain, especially one that has been quite contentious in the recent past. LLMs in healthcare provide a canvas for a relatively less explored space, and helps us illustrate how one could possibly envision enshrining the principles of PAI for a relatively new technology, in a space where innovation must always align with patient welfare.
