> Survey on Plagiarism Detection in Large Language Models: The Impact of ChatGPT and Gemini on Academic Integrity

# 摘要

> 随着ChatGPT和Gemini等大型语言模型的兴起，学术界面临了新挑战。学生借助这些模型轻松完成学业任务，而教育者则在检测AI内容上苦苦挣扎。这不仅加剧了学术不端行为，还使得教育者难以调整评估策略。本研究深入探讨了LLMs如何助长学术不诚实，并全面回顾了抄袭检测的最新技术。通过调查相关数据集、算法、工具及规避策略，我们旨在揭示现有解决方案的不足。最终，我们提出基于AI工具和教育方法的长期策略，以应对这一不断变化的挑战。

> The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Gemini has posed new challenges for the academic community. With the help of these models, students can easily complete their assignments and exams, while educators struggle to detect AI-generated content. This has led to a surge in academic misconduct, as students present work generated by LLMs as their own, without putting in the effort required for learning. As AI tools become more advanced and produce increasingly human-like text, detecting such content becomes more challenging. This development has significantly impacted the academic world, where many educators are finding it difficult to adapt their assessment methods to this challenge.
  This research first demonstrates how LLMs have increased academic dishonesty, and then reviews state-of-the-art solutions for academic plagiarism in detail. A survey of datasets, algorithms, tools, and evasion strategies for plagiarism detection has been conducted, focusing on how LLMs and AI-generated content (AIGC) detection have affected this area. The survey aims to identify the gaps in existing solutions. Lastly, potential long-term solutions are presented to address the issue of academic plagiarism using LLMs based on AI tools and educational approaches in an ever-changing world.
