# 摘要

> 随着传感与计算技术的飞跃，基于深度强化学习的策略在应对复杂多变的配电系统恢复挑战中崭露头角。但DRL对数据的依赖性，为解决大规模复杂系统的DSR问题带来了难题。借鉴大型语言模型等基础模型在多领域的革新力量，本文提出了一种新思路，即借助LLMs的强大计算力，突破传统DRL在DSR中的可扩展性瓶颈。本研究首次尝试将LLMs等基础模型引入电力系统运营，以重塑DRL的应用。我们的创新点包括：1）开发了一个由LLM赋能的物理信息决策变换器框架，旨在革新传统DRL的DSR方法；2）在框架初创阶段，通过对比研究评估其解决DSR问题的性能。尽管本文聚焦于DSR操作，该PIDT框架同样适用于优化电力系统中的序列决策过程。

> Driven by advancements in sensing and computing, deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based methods have demonstrated significant potential in effectively tackling distribution system restoration (DSR) challenges under uncertain operational scenarios. However, the data-intensive nature of DRL poses obstacles in achieving satisfactory DSR solutions for large-scale, complex distribution systems. Inspired by the transformative impact of emerging foundation models, including large language models (LLMs), across various domains, this paper explores an innovative approach harnessing LLMs' powerful computing capabilities to address scalability challenges inherent in conventional DRL methods for solving DSR. To our knowledge, this study represents the first exploration of foundation models, including LLMs, in revolutionizing conventional DRL applications in power system operations. Our contributions are twofold: 1) introducing a novel LLM-powered Physics-Informed Decision Transformer (PIDT) framework that leverages LLMs to transform conventional DRL methods for DSR operations, and 2) conducting comparative studies to assess the performance of the proposed LLM-powered PIDT framework at its initial development stage for solving DSR problems. While our primary focus in this paper is on DSR operations, the proposed PIDT framework can be generalized to optimize sequential decision-making across various power system operations.
