# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLM）正成为化学领域的强大工具，能够精准预测、分子设计、合成优化，并加速药物与材料研发。核心理念是将LLM与化学工具结合，形成“代理”。本文综述了LLM的发展历程、当前能力、设计挑战及未来趋势，特别关注代理在化学领域的应用。尽管代理在多领域表现出色，但仍面临挑战。未来方向包括开发多代理系统，采用人机协同方法。为追踪最新研究，特建立仓库：https://github.com/ur-whitelab/LLMs-in-science。

> Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a powerful tool in chemistry across multiple domains. In chemistry, LLMs are able to accurately predict properties, design new molecules, optimize synthesis pathways, and accelerate drug and material discovery. A core emerging idea is combining LLMs with chemistry-specific tools like synthesis planners and databases, leading to so-called "agents." This review covers LLMs' recent history, current capabilities, design, challenges specific to chemistry, and future directions. Particular attention is given to agents and their emergence as a cross-chemistry paradigm. Agents have proven effective in diverse domains of chemistry, but challenges remain. It is unclear if creating domain-specific versus generalist agents and developing autonomous pipelines versus "co-pilot" systems will accelerate chemistry. An emerging direction is the development of multi-agent systems using a human-in-the-loop approach. Due to the incredibly fast development of this field, a repository has been built to keep track of the latest studies: https://github.com/ur-whitelab/LLMs-in-science.
