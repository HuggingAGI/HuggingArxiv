> Building Artificial Intelligence with Creative Agency and Self-hood

# 摘要

> 本文受邀为外行读者总结了自催化网络框架如何模拟自我组织和自我维持结构的诞生，这些结构复杂到足以复制和进化，无论是生物体、文化创新思维还是大型语言模型等AI网络。该方法能分析并揭示其他方法难以解决的复杂网络中的相变，为构建自主且有能动性的AI提供了新思路。预计这种自催化AI将拥有类似人类的创造力，并通过创造活动实现心理治愈和自我认同的强化。

> This paper is an invited layperson summary for The Academic of the paper referenced on the last page. We summarize how the formal framework of autocatalytic networks offers a means of modeling the origins of self-organizing, self-sustaining structures that are sufficiently complex to reproduce and evolve, be they organisms undergoing biological evolution, novelty-generating minds driving cultural evolution, or artificial intelligence networks such as large language models. The approach can be used to analyze and detect phase transitions in vastly complex networks that have proven intractable with other approaches, and suggests a promising avenue to building an autonomous, agentic AI self. It seems reasonable to expect that such an autocatalytic AI would possess creative agency akin to that of humans, and undergo psychologically healing -- i.e., therapeutic -- internal transformation through engagement in creative tasks. Moreover, creative tasks would be expected to help such an AI solidify its self-identity.
