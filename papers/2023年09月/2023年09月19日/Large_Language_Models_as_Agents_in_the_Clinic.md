# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）的最新进展为医疗保健行业开辟了新的可能，涵盖了从信息整合到辅助临床决策的各个方面。这些先进的LLMs不仅能模拟语言，还能充当智能“代理”，与各方进行开放式交流，甚至参与临床决策过程。评估LLM代理的性能时，应超越传统的基准测试，转而考量其在现实临床任务中的表现。我们提出的“人工智能结构化临床考试”（AI-SCI）评估框架，借鉴了自动驾驶汽车等自主操作技术的评估方法。此外，高保真模拟技术可以用来评价用户与LLMs在临床流程中的互动，或模拟多个LLMs之间的动态交流。构建这些强有力的、符合实际的临床评估体系，对于将LLM代理实际应用于医疗保健领域至关重要。

> Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have unlocked new opportunities for healthcare, from information synthesis to clinical decision support. These new LLMs are not just capable of modeling language, but can also act as intelligent "agents" that interact with stakeholders in open-ended conversations and even influence clinical decision-making. Rather than relying on benchmarks that measure a model's ability to process clinical data or answer standardized test questions, LLM agents should be assessed for their performance on real-world clinical tasks. These new evaluation frameworks, which we call "Artificial-intelligence Structured Clinical Examinations" ("AI-SCI"), can draw from comparable technologies where machines operate with varying degrees of self-governance, such as self-driving cars. High-fidelity simulations may also be used to evaluate interactions between users and LLMs within a clinical workflow, or to model the dynamic interactions of multiple LLMs. Developing these robust, real-world clinical evaluations will be crucial towards deploying LLM agents into healthcare.
