> Using Large Language Models to Create AI Personas for Replication and Prediction of Media Effects: An Empirical Test of 133 Published Experimental Research Findings

# 摘要

> 本报告探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）在加速和准确复制已发表信息效果研究方面的潜力。通过使用Viewpoints AI工具，我们复制了《营销杂志》14篇论文中的133个实验发现，测试了LLM驱动的AI角色。结果显示，LLM成功复制了76%的主要效应，总体复制率达到68%，显示出AI在辅助复制媒体效应研究方面的强大能力。报告还探讨了LLM在解决社会科学复制危机、提高实验泛化性等方面的应用，并指出了当前方法在复制复杂交互效应方面的局限，提出了未来研究方向。

> This report analyzes the potential for large language models (LLMs) to expedite accurate replication of published message effects studies. We tested LLM-powered participants (personas) by replicating 133 experimental findings from 14 papers containing 45 recent studies in the Journal of Marketing (January 2023-May 2024). We used a new software tool, Viewpoints AI (https://viewpoints.ai/), that takes study designs, stimuli, and measures as input, automatically generates prompts for LLMs to act as a specified sample of unique personas, and collects their responses to produce a final output in the form of a complete dataset and statistical analysis. The underlying LLM used was Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 3.5. We generated 19,447 AI personas to replicate these studies with the exact same sample attributes, study designs, stimuli, and measures reported in the original human research. Our LLM replications successfully reproduced 76% of the original main effects (84 out of 111), demonstrating strong potential for AI-assisted replication of studies in which people respond to media stimuli. When including interaction effects, the overall replication rate was 68% (90 out of 133). The use of LLMs to replicate and accelerate marketing research on media effects is discussed with respect to the replication crisis in social science, potential solutions to generalizability problems in sampling subjects and experimental conditions, and the ability to rapidly test consumer responses to various media stimuli. We also address the limitations of this approach, particularly in replicating complex interaction effects in media response studies, and suggest areas for future research and improvement in AI-assisted experimental replication of media effects.
