> Interactive Agents: Simulating Counselor-Client Psychological Counseling via Role-Playing LLM-to-LLM Interactions

# 摘要

> 借助大型语言模型（LLM），我们设计了虚拟咨询师系统，旨在为心理健康挑战者提供互动支持。为模拟真实咨询场景，我们开发了在线平台，让专业咨询师通过文本形式，每次约一小时，为求助者提供咨询服务。然而，人工标注存在耗时、高成本、隐私保护及扩展性差等问题。为此，我们提出新框架，利用两个LLM通过角色扮演，模拟咨询师与客户的互动。一个LLM扮演真实用户，另一个则扮演资深咨询师，运用综合疗法技巧回应。我们采用GPT-4进行零-shot提示，实现双方角色。为评估LLM模拟效果，并探究其与人类对话的差异，我们多角度审视合成数据。首先，自动评估客户表现；其次，对比LLM与专业咨询师对话的异同。最后，通过广泛实验，以最先进模型为基准，全面检验基于LLM咨询师的表现。

> Virtual counselors powered by large language models (LLMs) aim to create interactive support systems that effectively assist clients struggling with mental health challenges. To replicate counselor-client conversations, researchers have built an online mental health platform that allows professional counselors to provide clients with text-based counseling services for about an hour per session. Notwithstanding its effectiveness, challenges exist as human annotation is time-consuming, cost-intensive, privacy-protected, and not scalable. To address this issue and investigate the applicability of LLMs in psychological counseling conversation simulation, we propose a framework that employs two LLMs via role-playing for simulating counselor-client interactions. Our framework involves two LLMs, one acting as a client equipped with a specific and real-life user profile and the other playing the role of an experienced counselor, generating professional responses using integrative therapy techniques. We implement both the counselor and the client by zero-shot prompting the GPT-4 model. In order to assess the effectiveness of LLMs in simulating counselor-client interactions and understand the disparities between LLM- and human-generated conversations, we evaluate the synthetic data from various perspectives. We begin by assessing the client's performance through automatic evaluations. Next, we analyze and compare the disparities between dialogues generated by the LLM and those generated by professional counselors. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to thoroughly examine the performance of our LLM-based counselor trained with synthetic interactive dialogues by benchmarking against state-of-the-art models for mental health.
