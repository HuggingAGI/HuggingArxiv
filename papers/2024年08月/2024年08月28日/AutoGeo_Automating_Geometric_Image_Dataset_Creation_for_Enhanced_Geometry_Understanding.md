# 摘要

> 随着大型语言模型的迅猛发展，其数学推理能力备受关注。然而，现有研究多聚焦于文本代数问题，几何学因缺乏高质量数据集而被忽视。为此，本文推出AutoGeo，一种自动生成数学几何图像的新方法，以满足大规模多样化几何数据集的需求。AutoGeo助力创建了包含100k高质量几何图像-文本对的AutoGeo-100k。通过精确几何子句，AutoGeo-100k涵盖了线条、多边形、圆及复杂空间关系等多种几何形状。实验表明，微调后的多模态大型语言模型在处理几何图像方面表现显著提升，如几何描述和数学推理任务的准确性提高。此研究不仅填补了几何数据集的空白，还为教育和研究中AI工具的发展开辟了新道路。项目页面：https://autogeo-official.github.io/。

> With the rapid advancement of large language models, there has been a growing interest in their capabilities in mathematical reasoning. However, existing research has primarily focused on text-based algebra problems, neglecting the study of geometry due to the lack of high-quality geometric datasets. To address this gap, this paper introduces AutoGeo, a novel approach for automatically generating mathematical geometric images to fulfill the demand for large-scale and diverse geometric datasets. AutoGeo facilitates the creation of AutoGeo-100k, an extensive repository comprising 100k high-quality geometry image-text pairs. By leveraging precisely defined geometric clauses, AutoGeo-100k contains a wide variety of geometric shapes, including lines, polygons, circles, and complex spatial relationships, etc. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the efficacy of AutoGeo-100k in enhancing the performance of multimodal large language models through fine-tuning. Experimental results indicate significant improvements in the model's ability in handling geometric images, as evidenced by enhanced accuracy in tasks such as geometric captioning and mathematical reasoning. This research not only fills a critical gap in the availability of geometric datasets but also paves the way for the advancement of sophisticated AI-driven tools in education and research.
