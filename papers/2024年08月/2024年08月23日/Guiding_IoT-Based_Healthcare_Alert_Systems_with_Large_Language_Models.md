# 摘要

> 随着AI和IoT技术的发展及健康意识的提升，医疗警报系统（HAS）正迅速演进。然而，如何在资源有限的环境中平衡个性化警报的准确性与隐私保护，仍是一大挑战。为此，我们提出了LLM-HAS框架，通过整合大型语言模型（LLM），不仅提升了警报的准确性，还确保了用户隐私，并优化了个性化健康服务，同时增强了用户体验。该框架采用混合专家（MoE）结合LLM的方法，从用户提供的文本信息中分析其偏好和健康风险，进而选择合适的深度强化学习（DDPG）专家进行精准警报。此外，LLM-HAS能处理用户对话反馈，进一步微调系统并增强用户互动，从而提升健康管理的精准度和个性化。模拟实验证实了LLM-HAS的有效性，展示了其作为利用生成AI提供高精度可靠警报的创新途径的潜力。

> Healthcare alert systems (HAS) are undergoing rapid evolution, propelled by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, and increasing health consciousness. Despite significant progress, a fundamental challenge remains: balancing the accuracy of personalized health alerts with stringent privacy protection in HAS environments constrained by resources. To address this issue, we introduce a uniform framework, LLM-HAS, which incorporates Large Language Models (LLM) into HAS to significantly boost the accuracy, ensure user privacy, and enhance personalized health service, while also improving the subjective quality of experience (QoE) for users. Our innovative framework leverages a Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach, augmented with LLM, to analyze users' personalized preferences and potential health risks from additional textual job descriptions. This analysis guides the selection of specialized Deep Reinforcement Learning (DDPG) experts, tasked with making precise health alerts. Moreover, LLM-HAS can process Conversational User Feedback, which not only allows fine-tuning of DDPG but also deepen user engagement, thereby enhancing both the accuracy and personalization of health management strategies. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the LLM-HAS framework, highlighting its potential as a groundbreaking approach for employing generative AI (GAI) to provide highly accurate and reliable alerts.
