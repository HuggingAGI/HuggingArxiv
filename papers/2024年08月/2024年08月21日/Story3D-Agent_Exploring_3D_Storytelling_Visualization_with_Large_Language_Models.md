> Story3D-Agent: Exploring 3D Storytelling Visualization with Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 传统视觉叙事复杂且受限于人类创造力，而大型语言模型虽有提升，却常局限于2D或简化故事。为此，我们创新推出Story3D-Agent，利用LLM将叙事转化为3D视觉，通过程序化建模精确掌控角色与环境，实现动态多维叙事。我们的方法还支持逻辑推理，确保内容连贯。经全面评估，Story3D-Agent有效，为3D叙事发展奠定基础。

> Traditional visual storytelling is complex, requiring specialized knowledge and substantial resources, yet often constrained by human creativity and creation precision. While Large Language Models (LLMs) enhance visual storytelling, current approaches often limit themselves to 2D visuals or oversimplify stories through motion synthesis and behavioral simulation, failing to create comprehensive, multi-dimensional narratives. To this end, we present Story3D-Agent, a pioneering approach that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to transform provided narratives into 3D-rendered visualizations. By integrating procedural modeling, our approach enables precise control over multi-character actions and motions, as well as diverse decorative elements, ensuring the long-range and dynamic 3D representation. Furthermore, our method supports narrative extension through logical reasoning, ensuring that generated content remains consistent with existing conditions. We have thoroughly evaluated our Story3D-Agent to validate its effectiveness, offering a basic framework to advance 3D story representation.
