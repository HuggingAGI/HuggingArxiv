# 摘要

> 深度学习在分子特性预测与生成设计领域的应用，正因其推动高性能新材料快速研发的潜力而备受瞩目。随着大型语言模型（LLM）及其驱动代理系统的兴起，这些研究流程已大幅升级，使得预训练模型能在更复杂的科研任务中发挥预测作用。然而，在材料设计任务中，代理系统在关键信息检索方面仍有待提升。同时，利用深度学习模型的潜在表示，如在代理系统中实现跨模态检索增强生成，以定制化材料设计，这一创新路径尚未被涉足。本文揭示，大型预训练化学基础模型可为小分子、复杂聚合物及化学反应提供语义信息检索基础。结合图像模型如OpenCLIP，我们实现了跨多数据域的突破性查询与信息检索。最终，通过多代理系统集成，我们促进了基于结构与拓扑的自然语言查询，为复杂科研任务提供信息检索支持。

> Molecular property prediction and generative design via deep learning models has been the subject of intense research given its potential to accelerate development of new, high-performance materials. More recently, these workflows have been significantly augmented with the advent of large language models (LLMs) and systems of LLM-driven agents capable of utilizing pre-trained models to make predictions in the context of more complex research tasks. While effective, there is still room for substantial improvement within the agentic systems on the retrieval of salient information for material design tasks. Moreover, alternative uses of predictive deep learning models, such as leveraging their latent representations to facilitate cross-modal retrieval augmented generation within agentic systems to enable task-specific materials design, has remained unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that large, pre-trained chemistry foundation models can serve as a basis for enabling semantic chemistry information retrieval for both small-molecules, complex polymeric materials, and reactions. Additionally, we show the use of chemistry foundation models in conjunction with image models such as OpenCLIP facilitate unprecedented queries and information retrieval across multiple characterization data domains. Finally, we demonstrate the integration of these systems within multi-agent systems to facilitate structure and topological-based natural language queries and information retrieval for complex research tasks.
