> GRAB: A Challenging GRaph Analysis Benchmark for Large Multimodal Models

# 摘要

> 大型多模态模型 (LMMs) 在众多视觉任务中表现出色，但现有基准已显不足。为此，我们迫切需要更具挑战性的新一代基准。LMMs 在图形分析领域展现出潜力，尤其是在分析师解读图表时的典型任务，如估计均值、截距或相关性。我们推出了 GRAB，一个专为当前及未来前沿 LMMs 设计的图形分析基准，包含 2170 个高质量、无噪音的问题，覆盖四类任务和 23 种图形属性。在 GRAB 上，20 个 LMMs 的评估显示其极具挑战性，最高得分仅 21.7%。通过消融实验，我们深入探究了模型的强项与弱点。GRAB 的发布旨在推动这一关键且不断发展的领域进步。

> Large multimodal models (LMMs) have exhibited proficiencies across many visual tasks. Although numerous well-known benchmarks exist to evaluate model performance, they increasingly have insufficient headroom. As such, there is a pressing need for a new generation of benchmarks challenging enough for the next generation of LMMs. One area that LMMs show potential is graph analysis, specifically, the tasks an analyst might typically perform when interpreting figures such as estimating the mean, intercepts or correlations of functions and data series. In this work, we introduce GRAB, a graph analysis benchmark, fit for current and future frontier LMMs. Our benchmark is entirely synthetic, ensuring high-quality, noise-free questions. GRAB is comprised of 2170 questions, covering four tasks and 23 graph properties. We evaluate 20 LMMs on GRAB, finding it to be a challenging benchmark, with the highest performing model attaining a score of just 21.7%. Finally, we conduct various ablations to investigate where the models succeed and struggle. We release GRAB to encourage progress in this important, growing domain.
