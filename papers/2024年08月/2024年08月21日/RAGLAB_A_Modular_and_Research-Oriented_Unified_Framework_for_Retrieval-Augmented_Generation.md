# 摘要

> 大型语言模型 (LLM) 在对话、推理和知识保留方面表现出色，但仍面临幻觉和知识实时更新等挑战。为解决这些问题，研究者采用检索增强生成 (RAG) 技术，但 RAG 的发展受限于缺乏算法比较和开源工具的透明度。为此，我们推出 RAGLAB，一个模块化、研究导向的开源库，重现 6 种算法并构建全面研究生态。借助 RAGLAB，我们在 10 个基准上公平对比 6 种算法，助力研究人员高效评估和创新算法。

> Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate human-level capabilities in dialogue, reasoning, and knowledge retention. However, even the most advanced LLMs face challenges such as hallucinations and real-time updating of their knowledge. Current research addresses this bottleneck by equipping LLMs with external knowledge, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, two key issues constrained the development of RAG. First, there is a growing lack of comprehensive and fair comparisons between novel RAG algorithms. Second, open-source tools such as LlamaIndex and LangChain employ high-level abstractions, which results in a lack of transparency and limits the ability to develop novel algorithms and evaluation metrics. To close this gap, we introduce RAGLAB, a modular and research-oriented open-source library. RAGLAB reproduces 6 existing algorithms and provides a comprehensive ecosystem for investigating RAG algorithms. Leveraging RAGLAB, we conduct a fair comparison of 6 RAG algorithms across 10 benchmarks. With RAGLAB, researchers can efficiently compare the performance of various algorithms and develop novel algorithms.
