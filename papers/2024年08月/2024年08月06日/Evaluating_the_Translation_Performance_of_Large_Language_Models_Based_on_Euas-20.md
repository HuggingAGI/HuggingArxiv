> Evaluating the Translation Performance of Large Language Models Based on Euas-20

# 摘要

> 随着深度学习的迅猛发展，BERT和GPT等大型语言模型在自然语言处理领域取得了显著成就。机器翻译作为该领域的关键任务，同样得益于这些模型的进步，实现了质的提升。然而，尽管翻译性能大幅提升，机器翻译仍面临诸多挑战。为此，我们构建了Euas-20数据集，旨在评估大型语言模型在翻译任务中的表现、不同语言的翻译能力，以及预训练数据对翻译能力的影响，为研究者和开发者提供参考。

> In recent years, with the rapid development of deep learning technology, large language models (LLMs) such as BERT and GPT have achieved breakthrough results in natural language processing tasks. Machine translation (MT), as one of the core tasks of natural language processing, has also benefited from the development of large language models and achieved a qualitative leap. Despite the significant progress in translation performance achieved by large language models, machine translation still faces many challenges. Therefore, in this paper, we construct the dataset Euas-20 to evaluate the performance of large language models on translation tasks, the translation ability on different languages, and the effect of pre-training data on the translation ability of LLMs for researchers and developers.
