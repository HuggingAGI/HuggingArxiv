# 摘要

> 随着软件开发的飞速发展，加强安全措施势在必行。如今，通过新闻文章获取软件故障信息变得更为便捷。本研究采用FAIL模型，旨在提取行业专属信息。尽管FAIL模型数据丰富，但通过深化分类和行业洞察，能更有效地助力软件工程师。过往研究中，我们已从权威来源收集新闻文章，并按事件分类存储于数据库。随后，运用Prompt工程和LLMs技术，精准提取软件故障相关信息。本研究在此基础上，进一步将文章细分为特定领域和故障类型，并通过图表直观呈现结果。分析表明，某些软件故障在特定行业中尤为常见。这种分类为工程师和公司提供了宝贵工具，助力他们识别并解决常见问题。本研究凸显了软件工程与LLMs的协同效应，旨在自动化并强化软件故障分析。通过将数据转化为行业专属模型，我们打造了一个实用资源，可用于识别漏洞、预测风险并采取预防措施。借助FAIL数据库与数据可视化的强大功能，我们致力于推动未来软件的安全与可靠性。

> The rapid evolution of software development necessitates enhanced safety measures. Extracting information about software failures from companies is becoming increasingly more available through news articles.
  This research utilizes the Failure Analysis Investigation with LLMs (FAIL) model to extract industry-specific information. Although the FAIL model's database is rich in information, it could benefit from further categorization and industry-specific insights to further assist software engineers.
  In previous work news articles were collected from reputable sources and categorized by incidents inside a database. Prompt engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) were then applied to extract relevant information regarding the software failure. This research extends these methods by categorizing articles into specific domains and types of software failures. The results are visually represented through graphs.
  The analysis shows that throughout the database some software failures occur significantly more often in specific industries. This categorization provides a valuable resource for software engineers and companies to identify and address common failures.
  This research highlights the synergy between software engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance the analysis of software failures. By transforming data from the database into an industry specific model, we provide a valuable resource that can be used to identify common vulnerabilities, predict potential risks, and implement proactive measures for preventing software failures. Leveraging the power of the current FAIL database and data visualization, we aim to provide an avenue for safer and more secure software in the future.
