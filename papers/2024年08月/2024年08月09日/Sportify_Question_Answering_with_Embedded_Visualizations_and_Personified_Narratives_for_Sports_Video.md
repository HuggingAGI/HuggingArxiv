> Sportify: Question Answering with Embedded Visualizations and Personified Narratives for Sports Video

# 摘要

> 随着篮球的普及，球迷们常因比赛的快速节奏和复杂性感到困惑。篮球战术的复杂性需要深入理解，而过多的解释信息又可能分散球迷的注意力。为此，我们开发了Sportify，一个结合叙事和可视化的视觉问答系统，旨在简化篮球战术的解读，帮助球迷更好地理解比赛。我们设计了三种动作可视化（传球、切入、掩护）来展示关键动作序列，并利用大型语言模型生成叙事，从第一和第三人称视角讲述复杂场景，增强理解。通过与篮球球迷的互动评估，我们发现Sportify不仅加深了战术理解，还提升了观看体验。第三人称叙事提供深入解析，而第一人称叙事则增强了球迷的参与感。

> As basketball's popularity surges, fans often find themselves confused and overwhelmed by the rapid game pace and complexity. Basketball tactics, involving a complex series of actions, require substantial knowledge to be fully understood. This complexity leads to a need for additional information and explanation, which can distract fans from the game. To tackle these challenges, we present Sportify, a Visual Question Answering system that integrates narratives and embedded visualization for demystifying basketball tactical questions, aiding fans in understanding various game aspects. We propose three novel action visualizations (i.e., Pass, Cut, and Screen) to demonstrate critical action sequences. To explain the reasoning and logic behind players' actions, we leverage a large-language model (LLM) to generate narratives. We adopt a storytelling approach for complex scenarios from both first and third-person perspectives, integrating action visualizations. We evaluated Sportify with basketball fans to investigate its impact on understanding of tactics, and how different personal perspectives of narratives impact the understanding of complex tactic with action visualizations. Our evaluation with basketball fans demonstrates Sportify's capability to deepen tactical insights and amplify the viewing experience. Furthermore, third-person narration assists people in getting in-depth game explanations while first-person narration enhances fans' game engagement
