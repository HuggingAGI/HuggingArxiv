> AttackER: Towards Enhancing Cyber-Attack Attribution with a Named Entity Recognition Dataset

# 摘要

> 网络攻击归因是实施针对性反制措施和法律行动的关键环节。由于任务复杂，分析师通常手动进行归因。AI，尤其是NLP技术，能辅助分析师，但面临数据集匮乏的挑战。本研究填补了这一空白，提供了首个网络攻击归因数据集。我们利用NLP的NER方法，从安全文本中提取归因信息，数据集注释丰富，包含跨句的上下文细节。实验证明，该数据集有效，且展示了LLMs在提升网络安全NER任务中的潜力。

> Cyber-attack attribution is an important process that allows experts to put in place attacker-oriented countermeasures and legal actions. The analysts mainly perform attribution manually, given the complex nature of this task. AI and, more specifically, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be leveraged to support cybersecurity analysts during the attribution process. However powerful these techniques are, they need to deal with the lack of datasets in the attack attribution domain. In this work, we will fill this gap and will provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset on cyber-attack attribution. We designed our dataset with the primary goal of extracting attack attribution information from cybersecurity texts, utilizing named entity recognition (NER) methodologies from the field of NLP. Unlike other cybersecurity NER datasets, ours offers a rich set of annotations with contextual details, including some that span phrases and sentences. We conducted extensive experiments and applied NLP techniques to demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness for attack attribution. These experiments highlight the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) capabilities to improve the NER tasks in cybersecurity datasets for cyber-attack attribution.
