> 本研究聚焦于 LLMTIME 模型，探讨其在时间序列预测中的应用。尽管 LLM 在多项任务中表现出色，但在时间序列预测领域，大型语言模型面临显著挑战。我们通过多个数据集测试 LLMTIME 性能，并引入经典近似周期函数进行评估。实证显示，尽管在特定数据集上零-shot 预测效果良好，但面对复杂多变的时间序列和传统信号，预测准确性大打折扣。研究发现，LLMTIME 在处理含周期、趋势及复杂频率成分的数据时，预测能力显著减弱。

> This research examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in predicting time series, with a specific focus on the LLMTIME model. Despite the established effectiveness of LLMs in tasks such as text generation, language translation, and sentiment analysis, this study highlights the key challenges that large language models encounter in the context of time series prediction. We assess the performance of LLMTIME across multiple datasets and introduce classical almost periodic functions as time series to gauge its effectiveness. The empirical results indicate that while large language models can perform well in zero-shot forecasting for certain datasets, their predictive accuracy diminishes notably when confronted with diverse time series data and traditional signals. The primary finding of this study is that the predictive capacity of LLMTIME, similar to other LLMs, significantly deteriorates when dealing with time series data that contain both periodic and trend components, as well as when the signal comprises complex frequency components.
