# 摘要

> 近年来，大型语言模型如OpenAI的GPT系列取得了显著进步，以其跨学科专业知识和快速适应用户提示的能力，展现出作为个性化学习工具的独特潜力。然而，这些模型在K-12教育领域的应用仍鲜有探索。本文首次进行随机对照试验（n=23），评估GPT-4在中学生个性化教育科学文本中的效果。研究中，GPT-4根据训练期间的选择分析学生学习偏好，实验组文本按学生偏好重写，对照组则相反。结果显示，学生更偏好与其偏好一致的文本（p=.059），表明GPT-4能有效解读并定制教育内容，推动个性化学习技术的发展。同时，本文也探讨了研究的局限性和人工智能在教育中的伦理问题。

> Large language models (LLMs), including OpenAI's GPT-series, have made significant advancements in recent years. Known for their expertise across diverse subject areas and quick adaptability to user-provided prompts, LLMs hold unique potential as Personalized Learning (PL) tools. Despite this potential, their application in K-12 education remains largely unexplored. This paper presents one of the first randomized controlled trials (n = 23) to evaluate the effectiveness of GPT-4 in personalizing educational science texts for middle school students. In this study, GPT-4 was used to profile student learning preferences based on choices made during a training session. For the experimental group, GPT-4 was used to rewrite science texts to align with the student's predicted profile while, for students in the control group, texts were rewritten to contradict their learning preferences. The results of a Mann-Whitney U test showed that students significantly preferred (at the .10 level) the rewritten texts when they were aligned with their profile (p = .059). These findings suggest that GPT-4 can effectively interpret and tailor educational content to diverse learner preferences, marking a significant advancement in PL technology. The limitations of this study and ethical considerations for using artificial intelligence in education are also discussed.
