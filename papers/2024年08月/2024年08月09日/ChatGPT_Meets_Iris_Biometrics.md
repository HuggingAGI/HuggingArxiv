# 摘要

> 本研究借助GPT-4的强大功能，深入探索了其在虹膜识别这一专业领域的应用潜力。通过一系列精密的实验，我们评估了ChatGPT-4在处理复杂虹膜图像时的表现，包括识别独特特征和检测细微变化如化妆的影响。与Gemini Advanced的对比显示，ChatGPT-4在虹膜分析任务中表现更佳，用户体验也更优。这项研究不仅证实了LLM在生物识别领域的应用价值，还强调了精细的查询设计和交互策略在提取生物识别数据深层信息中的关键作用。我们的研究成果预示着未来在开发更高效、灵活的生物识别安全技术方面具有广阔前景。

> This study utilizes the advanced capabilities of the GPT-4 multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) to explore its potential in iris recognition - a field less common and more specialized than face recognition. By focusing on this niche yet crucial area, we investigate how well AI tools like ChatGPT can understand and analyze iris images. Through a series of meticulously designed experiments employing a zero-shot learning approach, the capabilities of ChatGPT-4 was assessed across various challenging conditions including diverse datasets, presentation attacks, occlusions such as glasses, and other real-world variations. The findings convey ChatGPT-4's remarkable adaptability and precision, revealing its proficiency in identifying distinctive iris features, while also detecting subtle effects like makeup on iris recognition. A comparative analysis with Gemini Advanced - Google's AI model - highlighted ChatGPT-4's better performance and user experience in complex iris analysis tasks. This research not only validates the use of LLMs for specialized biometric applications but also emphasizes the importance of nuanced query framing and interaction design in extracting significant insights from biometric data. Our findings suggest a promising path for future research and the development of more adaptable, efficient, robust and interactive biometric security solutions.
