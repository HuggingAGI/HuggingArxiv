> Generating novel experimental hypotheses from language models: A case study on cross-dative generalization

# 摘要

> 神经网络语言模型 (LMs) 已成功捕捉复杂语言知识，但在语言习得理解上的应用仍存争议。我们通过案例研究，利用 LMs 模拟学习者，推导新实验假设以供人类验证，为辩论贡献新视角。我们聚焦跨格位泛化 (CDG)，即新动词在不同格位结构间的泛化，使用儿童导向语言训练的 LMs 进行研究。我们探究：“训练中哪些因素促进新动词向未建模结构的泛化？”通过系统调整新动词出现的上下文属性，分析 LMs 对新动词的使用，我们发现 LMs 再现儿童 CDG 模式，为新假设探索奠定基础。进一步模拟揭示，当暴露上下文的第一个后动词论元为代词、确定、简短且符合典型生命性预期时，CDG 更易发生。这反映格位和谐对齐特征，即高话语突出度论元优先。由此提出新假设：CDG 促进与暴露上下文特征（尤其是首个后动词论元）的和谐对齐程度相关。未来实验将验证此假设在儿童中的适用性。

> Neural network language models (LMs) have been shown to successfully capture complex linguistic knowledge. However, their utility for understanding language acquisition is still debated. We contribute to this debate by presenting a case study where we use LMs as simulated learners to derive novel experimental hypotheses to be tested with humans. We apply this paradigm to study cross-dative generalization (CDG): productive generalization of novel verbs across dative constructions (she pilked me the ball/she pilked the ball to me) -- acquisition of which is known to involve a large space of contextual features -- using LMs trained on child-directed speech. We specifically ask: "what properties of the training exposure facilitate a novel verb's generalization to the (unmodeled) alternate construction?" To answer this, we systematically vary the exposure context in which a novel dative verb occurs in terms of the properties of the theme and recipient, and then analyze the LMs' usage of the novel verb in the unmodeled dative construction. We find LMs to replicate known patterns of children's CDG, as a precondition to exploring novel hypotheses. Subsequent simulations reveal a nuanced role of the features of the novel verbs' exposure context on the LMs' CDG. We find CDG to be facilitated when the first postverbal argument of the exposure context is pronominal, definite, short, and conforms to the prototypical animacy expectations of the exposure dative. These patterns are characteristic of harmonic alignment in datives, where the argument with features ranking higher on the discourse prominence scale tends to precede the other. This gives rise to a novel hypothesis that CDG is facilitated insofar as the features of the exposure context -- in particular, its first postverbal argument -- are harmonically aligned. We conclude by proposing future experiments that can test this hypothesis in children.
