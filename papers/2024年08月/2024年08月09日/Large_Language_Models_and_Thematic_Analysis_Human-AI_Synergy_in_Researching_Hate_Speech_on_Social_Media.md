> Large Language Models and Thematic Analysis: Human-AI Synergy in Researching Hate Speech on Social Media

# 摘要

> 在AI的快速发展领域，LLMs在文本分析中的应用备受学术关注。尽管LLMs在定性分析中展现出潜力，但其在人文社科领域的应用仍待深入探索。本文通过一项GPT-4实验研究，探讨了LLMs在定性分析中的应用，特别是使用欧盟项目中的YouTube数据集进行主题分析，该数据集涉及2016年瑞典罗姆移民的表征。我们的研究旨在探索人机结合的潜力，分析LLMs在人文社科定性研究中的优势与局限，并展望其未来应用方向。

> In the dynamic field of artificial intelligence (AI), the development and application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for text analysis are of significant academic interest. Despite the promising capabilities of various LLMs in conducting qualitative analysis, their use in the humanities and social sciences has not been thoroughly examined. This article contributes to the emerging literature on LLMs in qualitative analysis by documenting an experimental study involving GPT-4. The study focuses on performing thematic analysis (TA) using a YouTube dataset derived from an EU-funded project, which was previously analyzed by other researchers. This dataset is about the representation of Roma migrants in Sweden during 2016, a period marked by the aftermath of the 2015 refugee crisis and preceding the Swedish national elections in 2017. Our study seeks to understand the potential of combining human intelligence with AI's scalability and efficiency, examining the advantages and limitations of employing LLMs in qualitative research within the humanities and social sciences. Additionally, we discuss future directions for applying LLMs in these fields.
