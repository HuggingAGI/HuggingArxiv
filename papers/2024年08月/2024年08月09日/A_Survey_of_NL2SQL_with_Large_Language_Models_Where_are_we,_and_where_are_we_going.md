> A Survey of NL2SQL with Large Language Models: Where are we, and where are we going?

# 摘要

> 将自然语言查询转换为 SQL 查询（NL2SQL）不仅降低了访问数据库的门槛，还促进了商业应用的发展。随着大型语言模型的兴起，NL2SQL 技术得到了显著提升。本调查全面审视了 LLM 驱动的 NL2SQL 技术，从模型构建、数据处理、评估方法到错误分析四个维度进行了深入探讨。我们不仅提供了开发 NL2SQL 解决方案的实用指南，还指出了在 LLM 时代 NL2SQL 面临的研究挑战和未解之谜。

> Translating users' natural language queries (NL) into SQL queries (i.e., NL2SQL) can significantly reduce barriers to accessing relational databases and support various commercial applications. The performance of NL2SQL has been greatly enhanced with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of NL2SQL techniques powered by LLMs, covering its entire lifecycle from the following four aspects: (1) Model: NL2SQL translation techniques that tackle not only NL ambiguity and under-specification, but also properly map NL with database schema and instances; (2) Data: From the collection of training data, data synthesis due to training data scarcity, to NL2SQL benchmarks; (3) Evaluation: Evaluating NL2SQL methods from multiple angles using different metrics and granularities; and (4) Error Analysis: analyzing NL2SQL errors to find the root cause and guiding NL2SQL models to evolve. Moreover, we provide a rule of thumb for developing NL2SQL solutions. Finally, we discuss the research challenges and open problems of NL2SQL in the LLMs era.
