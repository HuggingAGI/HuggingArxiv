# 摘要

> 随着顺序教育数据的收集与分析技术不断进步，时间序列分析在教育研究中的重要性日益凸显，成为推动数据驱动决策的关键。尽管如此，目前尚无全面总结这些进展的文献。本文首次系统综述了教育领域内的时间序列分析技术，首先梳理了教育数据分析的框架，并对相关数据源和类型进行了细致分类。随后，我们深入探讨了预测、分类、聚类和异常检测这四种时间序列方法在教育场景中的具体应用。此外，我们还展示了这些方法如何协同解决多样化的教育任务，强调了其在复杂教育问题中的实际应用价值。最后，我们展望了未来研究方向，涵盖个性化学习分析、多模态数据融合及大型语言模型在教育时间序列中的潜在角色。本文不仅提供了教育数据的详尽分类，还整合了时间序列技术与教育实践，并对教育分析的未来趋势进行了前瞻性探讨。相关研究资料可在项目页面持续获取并更新。

> Recent advancements in the collection and analysis of sequential educational data have brought time series analysis to a pivotal position in educational research, highlighting its essential role in facilitating data-driven decision-making. However, there is a lack of comprehensive summaries that consolidate these advancements. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to provide a comprehensive review of time series analysis techniques specifically within the educational context. We begin by exploring the landscape of educational data analytics, categorizing various data sources and types relevant to education. We then review four prominent time series methods-forecasting, classification, clustering, and anomaly detection-illustrating their specific application points in educational settings. Subsequently, we present a range of educational scenarios and applications, focusing on how these methods are employed to address diverse educational tasks, which highlights the practical integration of multiple time series methods to solve complex educational problems. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on future directions, including personalized learning analytics, multimodal data fusion, and the role of large language models (LLMs) in educational time series. The contributions of this paper include a detailed taxonomy of educational data, a synthesis of time series techniques with specific educational applications, and a forward-looking perspective on emerging trends and future research opportunities in educational analysis.
