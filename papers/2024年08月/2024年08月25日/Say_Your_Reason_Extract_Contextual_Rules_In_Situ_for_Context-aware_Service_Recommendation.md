> Say Your Reason: Extract Contextual Rules In Situ for Context-aware Service Recommendation

# 摘要

> 本文介绍的 SayRea 系统，通过交互方式帮助用户在移动环境中提取个性化服务推荐的上下文规则。它通过辅助功能监控用户在手机上的服务操作，并主动询问用户简短理由。借助大型语言模型，SayRea 解析这些理由，预测服务与上下文间的关联，如深夜设置闹钟。这不仅减轻了用户的认知负担，还提高了服务推荐的准确性。一项为期 10 天的实验显示，SayRea 平均为每位用户生成 62.4 条规则，成功推荐服务使用率达 45%。用户对系统的易用性、透明度和控制感给予好评，证实了 SayRea 在提升移动场景用户体验方面的潜力。

> This paper introduces SayRea, an interactive system that facilitates the extraction of contextual rules for personalized context-aware service recommendations in mobile scenarios. The system monitors a user's execution of registered services on their smartphones (via accessibility service) and proactively requests a single-sentence reason from the user. By utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM), SayRea parses the reason and predicts contextual relationships between the observed service and potential contexts (such as setting the alarm clock deep in the evening). In this way, SayRea can significantly reduce the cognitive load on users in anticipating future needs and selecting contextual attributes. A 10-day field study involving 20 participants showed that SayRea accumulated an average of 62.4 rules per user and successfully recommended 45% of service usage. The participants provided positive feedback on the system's usability, interpretability, and controllability. The findings highlight SayRea's effectiveness in personalized service recommendations and its potential to enhance user experience in mobile scenarios.
