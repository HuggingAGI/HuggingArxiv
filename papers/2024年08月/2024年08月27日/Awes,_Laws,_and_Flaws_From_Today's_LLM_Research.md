# 摘要

> 我们深入探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）研究的科学方法，评估了2,000多项研究，并结合争议焦点进行交叉验证。研究发现，涌现行为的主张减少，伦理声明增多，LLM作为评估者的角色增强。本文强调，该领域需加强审查与严谨性，批判性阅读与文献熟悉度对于维护伦理、可重复、系统且开放批评的科学方法至关重要。

> We perform a critical examination of the scientific methodology behind contemporary large language model (LLM) research. For this we assess over 2,000 research works based on criteria typical of what is considered good research (e.g. presence of statistical tests and reproducibility) and cross-validate it with arguments that are at the centre of controversy (e.g., claims of emergent behaviour, the use of LLMs as evaluators). We find multiple trends, such as declines in claims of emergent behaviour and the presence of ethics disclaimers; and the rise of LLMs as evaluators. This paper underscores the need for more scrutiny and rigour by and from this field. Critical reading and familiarity with the literature are crucial to live up to the fundamentals of a responsible scientific method that is ethical, reproducible, systematic, and open to criticism.
