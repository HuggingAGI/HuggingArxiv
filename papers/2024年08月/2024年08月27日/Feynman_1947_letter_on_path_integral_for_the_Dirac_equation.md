> Feynman 1947 letter on path integral for the Dirac equation

# 摘要

> 摘要：1947年，Richard Feynman在Shelter Island会议前四个月，向Theodore Welton寄出了一封长信，详细阐述了他尝试用路径积分描述Dirac粒子传播的努力。尽管这些尝试最终未能成功，且很快被另一种处理QED中电子传播子的方法所取代，但这封信不仅为我们揭示了Feynman在QED发展前夕的思考，也因其科学价值而引人入胜。信末，Feynman还附上了几句哲学性的评论，并以一句“胡说八道，到此为止”作结。本文不仅提供了这封信的转录和编辑笔记，还附有原始手稿的复印件，并简要探讨了Feynman的这些努力与后续研究之间的联系。

Abstract:In 1947, four months before the famous Shelter Island conference, Richard Feynman wrote a lengthy letter to his former MIT classmate Theodore Welton, reporting on his efforts to develop a path integral describing the propagation of a Dirac particle. While these efforts never came to fruition, and were shortly abandoned in favor of a very different method of dealing with the electron propagator appearing in in QED, the letter is interesting both from the historical viewpoint of revealing what Feynman was thinking about during that period just before the development of QED, and for its scientific ideas. It also contains at the end some philosophical remarks, which Feynman wraps up with the comment, ``Well enough for the baloney.'' In this article I present a transcription of the letter along with editorial notes, and a facsimile of the original handwritten document. I also briefly comment on Feynman's efforts and discuss their relation to some later work.
