> Constructing Mechanical Design Agent Based on Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 自古以来，机械设计辅助工具的开发旨在提升设计效率与效果。尽管现代CAD系统普及，但仍面临高学习成本和重复工作等难题。近年来，LLM的兴起为机械设计领域带来了新机遇。然而，仅依赖LLM直接完成设计任务尚不现实。我们通过探索，提出了一种构建全面MDA的方法，并通过实验验证了其有效性，展示了相关案例。

> Since ancient times, mechanical design aids have been developed to assist human users, aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of design. However, even with the widespread use of contemporary Computer-Aided Design (CAD) systems, there are still high learning costs, repetitive work, and other challenges. In recent years, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced new productivity opportunities to the field of mechanical design. Yet, it remains unrealistic to rely on LLMs alone to complete mechanical design tasks directly. Through a series of explorations, we propose a method for constructing a comprehensive Mechanical Design Agent (MDA) by guiding LLM learning. To verify the validity of our proposed method, we conducted a series of experiments and presented relevant cases.
