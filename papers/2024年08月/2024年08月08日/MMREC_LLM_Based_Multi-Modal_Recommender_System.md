# 摘要

> 随着每日内容产量的激增，推荐系统的价值日益凸显。面对这一挑战，本文创新性地结合大型语言模型（LLMs）与深度学习技术，提出了一种提升推荐系统效能的新框架。该框架通过融合多模态信息与统一潜在空间表示，旨在提升推荐的质量与相关性。研究不仅揭示了LLMs在处理推荐场景中自然语言数据的潜力，还通过实验验证了多模态信息整合对模型判别力的提升。这一进展不仅推动了推荐系统领域的发展，更为个性化与情境化推荐开辟了新路径。

> The importance of recommender systems is growing rapidly due to the exponential increase in the volume of content generated daily. This surge in content presents unique challenges for designing effective recommender systems. Key among these challenges is the need to effectively leverage the vast amounts of natural language data and images that represent user preferences. This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing recommender systems by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and deep learning techniques. The proposed framework aims to improve the accuracy and relevance of recommendations by incorporating multi-modal information processing and by the use of unified latent space representation. The study explores the potential of LLMs to better understand and utilize natural language data in recommendation contexts, addressing the limitations of previous methods. The framework efficiently extracts and integrates text and image information through LLMs, unifying diverse modalities in a latent space to simplify the learning process for the ranking model. Experimental results demonstrate the enhanced discriminative power of the model when utilizing multi-modal information. This research contributes to the evolving field of recommender systems by showcasing the potential of LLMs and multi-modal data integration to create more personalized and contextually relevant recommendations.
