> Are Social Sentiments Inherent in LLMs? An Empirical Study on Extraction of Inter-demographic Sentiments

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型 (LLM) 旨在通过大量文本训练来捕捉人类无意识的知识和情感，如社会常识和偏见。然而，特定社会群体的情感在 LLM 中的表现仍是个谜。本研究聚焦于以国籍、宗教和种族/民族划分的社会群体，探究 LLM 对这些群体间情感的捕捉能力。我们通过向 LLM 输入群体间情感问题，进行情感分析，并对比社会调查结果。结果显示，对于数据量较大的国籍和宗教群体，LLM 的情感分析与实际社会调查高度一致，表明 LLM 能有效反映群体间情感。

> Large language models (LLMs) are supposed to acquire unconscious human knowledge and feelings, such as social common sense and biases, by training models from large amounts of text. However, it is not clear how much the sentiments of specific social groups can be captured in various LLMs. In this study, we focus on social groups defined in terms of nationality, religion, and race/ethnicity, and validate the extent to which sentiments between social groups can be captured in and extracted from LLMs. Specifically, we input questions regarding sentiments from one group to another into LLMs, apply sentiment analysis to the responses, and compare the results with social surveys. The validation results using five representative LLMs showed higher correlations with relatively small p-values for nationalities and religions, whose number of data points were relatively large. This result indicates that the LLM responses including the inter-group sentiments align well with actual social survey results.
