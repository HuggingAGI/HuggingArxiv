> Deep Generative Models in Robotics: A Survey on Learning from Multimodal Demonstrations

# 摘要

> 随着深度生成模型的兴起，从演示中学习机器人行为模型这一领域正逐渐受到关注。尽管模仿学习、行为克隆等传统方法已研究多年，但它们在处理复杂数据分布或大规模演示时存在局限。近年来，机器人学习界对利用深度生成模型处理大数据集的复杂性表现出浓厚兴趣。本调查旨在全面回顾深度生成模型在机器人学中的最新进展，涵盖了基于能量的模型、扩散模型等多种模型类型，以及从抓取到轨迹生成的广泛应用。我们特别关注生成模型的分布外泛化能力，并探讨了提升这一能力的策略。最后，我们指出了当前的研究挑战，并展望了机器人学中深度生成模型未来的发展方向。

> Learning from Demonstrations, the field that proposes to learn robot behavior models from data, is gaining popularity with the emergence of deep generative models. Although the problem has been studied for years under names such as Imitation Learning, Behavioral Cloning, or Inverse Reinforcement Learning, classical methods have relied on models that don't capture complex data distributions well or don't scale well to large numbers of demonstrations. In recent years, the robot learning community has shown increasing interest in using deep generative models to capture the complexity of large datasets. In this survey, we aim to provide a unified and comprehensive review of the last year's progress in the use of deep generative models in robotics. We present the different types of models that the community has explored, such as energy-based models, diffusion models, action value maps, or generative adversarial networks. We also present the different types of applications in which deep generative models have been used, from grasp generation to trajectory generation or cost learning. One of the most important elements of generative models is the generalization out of distributions. In our survey, we review the different decisions the community has made to improve the generalization of the learned models. Finally, we highlight the research challenges and propose a number of future directions for learning deep generative models in robotics.
