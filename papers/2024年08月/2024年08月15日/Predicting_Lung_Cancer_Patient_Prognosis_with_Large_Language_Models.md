# 摘要

> 预测肺癌预后对制定最佳治疗方案至关重要。传统方法依赖回顾性数据模型，而大型语言模型（LLMs）因其强大的文本处理能力备受瞩目。本研究评估了GPT-4o mini和GPT-3.5在肺癌预后预测中的表现。我们收集了生存和术后并发症数据集，设计多项任务全面测试模型性能，并对比了逻辑回归模型。实验显示，即使不依赖额外患者数据，LLMs在预后预测中表现出色，甚至在某些方面超越传统模型。这表明，在患者数据稀缺时，LLMs是肺癌预后预测的得力工具。

> Prognosis prediction is crucial for determining optimal treatment plans for lung cancer patients. Traditionally, such predictions relied on models developed from retrospective patient data. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have gained attention for their ability to process and generate text based on extensive learned knowledge. In this study, we evaluate the potential of GPT-4o mini and GPT-3.5 in predicting the prognosis of lung cancer patients. We collected two prognosis datasets, i.e., survival and post-operative complication datasets, and designed multiple tasks to assess the models' performance comprehensively. Logistic regression models were also developed as baselines for comparison. The experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can achieve competitive, and in some tasks superior, performance in lung cancer prognosis prediction compared to data-driven logistic regression models despite not using additional patient data. These findings suggest that LLMs can be effective tools for prognosis prediction in lung cancer, particularly when patient data is limited or unavailable.
