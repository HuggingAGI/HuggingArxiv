> Autonomous Behavior Planning For Humanoid Loco-manipulation Through Grounded Language Model

# 摘要

> 让类人机器人自主在复杂环境中执行移动操作，是实现具身智能的关键挑战。这要求机器人能长时规划行动，并多模态感知执行偏差。近期，大型语言模型（LLMs）在机器人任务中展现了出色的语义理解和推理能力。为此，我们设计了一个基于LLMs的新框架，让机器人根据文本指令自主规划并执行任务，同时实时纠错。我们构建了机器人动作与感知库，通过CENTAURO机器人在模拟与真实环境中测试，验证了该框架在机器人自主行为规划中的有效性。

> Enabling humanoid robots to perform autonomously loco-manipulation in unstructured environments is crucial and highly challenging for achieving embodied intelligence. This involves robots being able to plan their actions and behaviors in long-horizon tasks while using multi-modality to perceive deviations between task execution and high-level planning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful planning and reasoning capabilities for comprehension and processing of semantic information through robot control tasks, as well as the usability of analytical judgment and decision-making for multi-modal inputs. To leverage the power of LLMs towards humanoid loco-manipulation, we propose a novel language-model based framework that enables robots to autonomously plan behaviors and low-level execution under given textual instructions, while observing and correcting failures that may occur during task execution. To systematically evaluate this framework in grounding LLMs, we created the robot 'action' and 'sensing' behavior library for task planning, and conducted mobile manipulation tasks and experiments in both simulated and real environments using the CENTAURO robot, and verified the effectiveness and application of this approach in robotic tasks with autonomous behavioral planning.
