> The ShareLM Collection and Plugin: Contributing Human-Model Chats for the Benefit of the Community

# 摘要

> 人类与模型的对话是洞察用户真实需求的关键，对模型研发极具价值。尽管商业公司通过API收集用户数据以优化自家模型，但开源与研究领域却相对滞后。为此，我们推出了ShareLM项目，包含一系列与大型语言模型的对话，并配套开发了Web扩展插件，鼓励用户自愿分享对话。此插件填补了平台间对话共享的空白，让用户能轻松分享来自各平台的对话。同时，用户可对对话进行评价，并在分享前删除敏感内容，确保隐私安全。我们诚邀更多社区成员加入，共同推动开放的人机对话数据发展。项目代码、插件及数据均已公开。

> Human-model conversations provide a window into users' real-world scenarios, behavior, and needs, and thus are a valuable resource for model development and research. While for-profit companies collect user data through the APIs of their models, using it internally to improve their own models, the open source and research community lags behind.
  We introduce the ShareLM collection, a unified set of human conversations with large language models, and its accompanying plugin, a Web extension for voluntarily contributing user-model conversations. Where few platforms share their chats, the ShareLM plugin adds this functionality, thus, allowing users to share conversations from most platforms. The plugin allows the user to rate their conversations, both at the conversation and the response levels, and delete conversations they prefer to keep private before they ever leave the user's local storage. We release the plugin conversations as part of the ShareLM collection, and call for more community effort in the field of open human-model data.
  The code, plugin, and data are available.
