# 摘要

> 本文展望了生成型与代理型AI时代的计算未来。现有软件系统僵化，难以将人类目标转化为有效计算行动。生成AI驱动的“活软件系统”为此提供了新思路。传统软件开发流程繁琐，导致系统僵化，难以适应用户需求变化。生成AI，尤其是大型语言模型，能有效桥接人类意图与计算机操作，推动更灵活、智能系统的开发。实现这一目标有两条路径：一是用生成AI优化传统开发流程，二是借助代理型AI打造真正自适应系统。提示工程等新技能变得至关重要。通过将软件视为活体，我们能构建更直观、强大、贴合人类需求的计算界面。

> This paper is an opinion paper that looks at the future of computing in the age of Generative \& Agentic AI. Current software systems are static and inflexible, leading to significant challenges in translating human goals into computational actions. "Living software systems" powered by generative AI offer a solution to this fundamental problem in computing. Traditional software development involves multiple layers of imperfect translation, from business requirements to code, resulting in rigid systems that struggle to adapt to changing user needs and contexts. Generative AI, particularly large language models, can serve as a universal translator between human intent and computer operations. This approach enables the creation of more flexible, context-aware systems that can dynamically evolve to meet user goals. Two pathways for implementing living software systems are explored: using generative AI to accelerate traditional software development, and leveraging agentic AI to create truly adaptive systems. New skills like Prompt Engineering are necessary. By reimagining software as a living, adaptable entity, we can create computing interfaces that are more intuitive, powerful, and responsive to human needs.
