> BreachSeek: A Multi-Agent Automated Penetration Tester

# 摘要

> 随着数字环境的日益复杂，传统渗透测试方法的局限性愈发明显，这些方法不仅耗时费力，还难以应对快速变化的威胁。为此，BreachSeek应运而生，它是一款AI驱动的多代理平台，利用Python中的LangChain和LangGraph集成的大型语言模型（LLM），实现自动化渗透测试。该系统能自主识别漏洞、模拟攻击、执行利用并生成详尽报告。初步测试显示，BreachSeek在本地网络中成功利用了多个漏洞，证明了其高效性。未来，BreachSeek将进一步增强功能，成为网络安全领域的得力助手。

> The increasing complexity and scale of modern digital environments have exposed significant gaps in traditional cybersecurity penetration testing methods, which are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and unable to rapidly adapt to emerging threats. There is a critical need for an automated solution that can efficiently identify and exploit vulnerabilities across diverse systems without extensive human intervention. BreachSeek addresses this challenge by providing an AI-driven multi-agent software platform that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated through LangChain and LangGraph in Python. This system enables autonomous agents to conduct thorough penetration testing by identifying vulnerabilities, simulating a variety of cyberattacks, executing exploits, and generating comprehensive security reports. In preliminary evaluations, BreachSeek successfully exploited vulnerabilities in exploitable machines within local networks, demonstrating its practical effectiveness. Future developments aim to expand its capabilities, positioning it as an indispensable tool for cybersecurity professionals.
