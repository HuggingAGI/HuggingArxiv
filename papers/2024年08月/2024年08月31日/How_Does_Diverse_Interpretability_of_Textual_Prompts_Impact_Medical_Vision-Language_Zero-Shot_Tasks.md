# 摘要

> 医学视觉-语言预训练 (MedVLP) 的进步通过大规模医学图像-文本对预训练，显著提升了零-shot 医学视觉任务的性能。然而，这些任务的性能极易受文本提示变异性的影响，凸显了 MedVLP 模型对多样化提示风格的鲁棒性需求。本研究首次系统评估了三种常用 MedVLP 方法对 15 种疾病多样提示的敏感性，设计了六种提示风格模拟临床场景，并按可解释性排序。结果显示，所有模型在不同提示下性能不稳定，且随着提示可解释性增加，性能波动，揭示了理解复杂医学概念的挑战。这强调了提升 MedVLP 方法鲁健性的必要性。

> Recent advancements in medical vision-language pre-training (MedVLP) have significantly enhanced zero-shot medical vision tasks such as image classification by leveraging large-scale medical image-text pair pre-training. However, the performance of these tasks can be heavily influenced by the variability in textual prompts describing the categories, necessitating robustness in MedVLP models to diverse prompt styles. Yet, this sensitivity remains underexplored. In this work, we are the first to systematically assess the sensitivity of three widely-used MedVLP methods to a variety of prompts across 15 different diseases. To achieve this, we designed six unique prompt styles to mirror real clinical scenarios, which were subsequently ranked by interpretability. Our findings indicate that all MedVLP models evaluated show unstable performance across different prompt styles, suggesting a lack of robustness. Additionally, the models' performance varied with increasing prompt interpretability, revealing difficulties in comprehending complex medical concepts. This study underscores the need for further development in MedVLP methodologies to enhance their robustness to diverse zero-shot prompts.
