# 摘要

> 随着生成式AI技术的进步，多智能体系统正被广泛应用于智慧城市，以提升其功能与效率。本文深入探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）与新兴的检索增强生成（RAG）技术在智能交通系统（ITS）中的革新潜力，旨在为城市交通难题提供创新解法。文章首先全面梳理了当前移动数据、ITS及互联车辆（CV）领域的最新进展。在此基础上，我们剖析了RAG技术的核心逻辑，并探讨了将其融入智能移动领域的广阔前景。我们构建了一个概念框架，旨在打造能够智能对话、高效服务于城市通勤者、交通运营商及决策者的多智能体系统。该框架致力于推动一种自主智能的交通管理新模式，包括：（a）通过科学咨询减少交通拥堵、事故与碳排放；（b）加强公众教育，提升参与式移动管理的效能；（c）自动化关键交通管理任务，并推动ITS平台如数据分析、知识表示及交通模拟的发展。通过LLM与RAG的深度融合，我们旨在突破传统基于规则的多智能体系统的局限，开创一个更可扩展、直观且自动化的多智能体新范式，引领ITS与城市移动性的革新发展。

> Leveraging recent advances in generative AI, multi-agent systems are increasingly being developed to enhance the functionality and efficiency of smart city applications. This paper explores the transformative potential of large language models (LLMs) and emerging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technologies in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), paving the way for innovative solutions to address critical challenges in urban mobility. We begin by providing a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in mobility data, ITS, and Connected Vehicles (CV) applications. Building on this review, we discuss the rationale behind RAG and examine the opportunities for integrating these Generative AI (GenAI) technologies into the smart mobility sector. We propose a conceptual framework aimed at developing multi-agent systems capable of intelligently and conversationally delivering smart mobility services to urban commuters, transportation operators, and decision-makers. Our approach seeks to foster an autonomous and intelligent approach that (a) promotes science-based advisory to reduce traffic congestion, accidents, and carbon emissions at multiple scales, (b) facilitates public education and engagement in participatory mobility management, and (c) automates specialized transportation management tasks and the development of critical ITS platforms, such as data analytics and interpretation, knowledge representation, and traffic simulations. By integrating LLM and RAG, our approach seeks to overcome the limitations of traditional rule-based multi-agent systems, which rely on fixed knowledge bases and limited reasoning capabilities. This integration paves the way for a more scalable, intuitive, and automated multi-agent paradigm, driving advancements in ITS and urban mobility.
