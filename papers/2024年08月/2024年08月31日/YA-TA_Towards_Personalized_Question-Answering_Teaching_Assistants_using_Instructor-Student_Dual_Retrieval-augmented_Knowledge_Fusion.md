> YA-TA: Towards Personalized Question-Answering Teaching Assistants using Instructor-Student Dual Retrieval-augmented Knowledge Fusion

# 摘要

> 教师与学生的互动对提升学术成绩至关重要，但在大班教学中，教师往往难以提供及时个性化的支持。为此，我们设计了名为YA-TA的虚拟教学助手，它能根据课程内容提供易懂的回答。我们创新的DRAKE框架，通过双重知识检索与融合，确保回应精准且个性化。实际课堂测试显示，DRAKE框架在知识对齐方面表现卓越。此外，YA-TA还配备了问答板和自我练习工具，全面提升学习体验。相关视频已公开。

> Engagement between instructors and students plays a crucial role in enhancing students'academic performance. However, instructors often struggle to provide timely and personalized support in large classes. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Virtual Teaching Assistant (VTA) named YA-TA, designed to offer responses to students that are grounded in lectures and are easy to understand. To facilitate YA-TA, we introduce the Dual Retrieval-augmented Knowledge Fusion (DRAKE) framework, which incorporates dual retrieval of instructor and student knowledge and knowledge fusion for tailored response generation. Experiments conducted in real-world classroom settings demonstrate that the DRAKE framework excels in aligning responses with knowledge retrieved from both instructor and student sides. Furthermore, we offer additional extensions of YA-TA, such as a Q&A board and self-practice tools to enhance the overall learning experience. Our video is publicly available.
