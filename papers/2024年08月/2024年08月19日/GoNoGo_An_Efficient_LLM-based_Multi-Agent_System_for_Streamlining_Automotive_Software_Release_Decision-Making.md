> GoNoGo: An Efficient LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Streamlining Automotive Software Release Decision-Making

# 摘要

> 传统汽车行业软件部署决策常依赖手动分析测试数据，导致成本高昂且发布周期延迟。大型语言模型（LLM）虽为解决方案，但其应用需多轮人工提示工程，限制了实际部署。为此，我们提出GoNoGo系统，专为简化汽车软件部署而设计，兼顾功能与工业实际需求。通过零-shot和少-shot示例，GoNoGo在难度至Level 2的任务中达100%成功率，且在复杂任务中表现依旧出色。该系统有效自动化简单任务决策，大幅减少人工干预。GoNoGo现已成为我们工业伙伴中高效、用户友好的LLM解决方案，助力风险敏感车辆系统发布决策，使之更明智及时。

> Traditional methods for making software deployment decisions in the automotive industry typically rely on manual analysis of tabular software test data. These methods often lead to higher costs and delays in the software release cycle due to their labor-intensive nature. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising solution to these challenges. However, their application generally demands multiple rounds of human-driven prompt engineering, which limits their practical deployment, particularly for industrial end-users who need reliable and efficient results. In this paper, we propose GoNoGo, an LLM agent system designed to streamline automotive software deployment while meeting both functional requirements and practical industrial constraints. Unlike previous systems, GoNoGo is specifically tailored to address domain-specific and risk-sensitive systems. We evaluate GoNoGo's performance across different task difficulties using zero-shot and few-shot examples taken from industrial practice. Our results show that GoNoGo achieves a 100% success rate for tasks up to Level 2 difficulty with 3-shot examples, and maintains high performance even for more complex tasks. We find that GoNoGo effectively automates decision-making for simpler tasks, significantly reducing the need for manual intervention. In summary, GoNoGo represents an efficient and user-friendly LLM-based solution currently employed in our industrial partner's company to assist with software release decision-making, supporting more informed and timely decisions in the release process for risk-sensitive vehicle systems.
