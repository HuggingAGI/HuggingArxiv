# 摘要

> GPT等神经语言模型通过大规模预训练，能精准捕捉文本语义，微调后显著提升语言生成质量。但现有歌词生成模型常忽略押韵这一关键要素，直接应用效果欠佳。为此，我们创新地将押韵信息整合进模型，有效提升了歌词生成的韵律美感。

> Neural language representation models such as GPT, pre-trained on large-scale corpora, can effectively capture rich semantic patterns from plain text and be fine-tuned to consistently improve natural language generation performance. However, existing pre-trained language models used to generate lyrics rarely consider rhyme information, which is crucial in lyrics. Using a pre-trained model directly results in poor performance. To enhance the rhyming quality of generated lyrics, we incorporate integrated rhyme information into our model, thereby improving lyric generation performance.
