> ASGM-KG: Unveiling Alluvial Gold Mining Through Knowledge Graphs

# 摘要

> 手工艺和小规模金矿开采（ASGM）虽成本低廉，却极具破坏性，导致全球热带流域环境灾难频发。ASGM涉及多个研究领域，知识分散于各类媒体和文档。为此，我们构建了ASGM知识图谱（ASGM-KG），整合关键信息，揭示其环境影响。ASGM-KG包含1,899个三元组，源自非政府和政府组织发布的精选文档，由热带生态学家团队筛选，并经大型语言模型（LLM）提取。我们采用两种验证方法：ASGM专家团队审查并标记事实性，以及自动事实简化框架，结合搜索引擎和LLM进行标记。该框架在公开知识图谱上表现卓越，ASGM-KG经专家验证，准确率超90%。ASGM-KG在复杂跨学科环境危机中，展现了知识聚合与表示的显著进步。

> Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining (ASGM) is a low-cost yet highly destructive mining practice, leading to environmental disasters across the world's tropical watersheds. The topic of ASGM spans multiple domains of research and information, including natural and social systems, and knowledge is often atomized across a diversity of media and documents. We therefore introduce a knowledge graph (ASGM-KG) that consolidates and provides crucial information about ASGM practices and their environmental effects. The current version of ASGM-KG consists of 1,899 triples extracted using a large language model (LLM) from documents and reports published by both non-governmental and governmental organizations. These documents were carefully selected by a group of tropical ecologists with expertise in ASGM. This knowledge graph was validated using two methods. First, a small team of ASGM experts reviewed and labeled triples as factual or non-factual. Second, we devised and applied an automated factual reduction framework that relies on a search engine and an LLM for labeling triples. Our framework performs as well as five baselines on a publicly available knowledge graph and achieves over 90 accuracy on our ASGM-KG validated by domain experts. ASGM-KG demonstrates an advancement in knowledge aggregation and representation for complex, interdisciplinary environmental crises such as ASGM.
