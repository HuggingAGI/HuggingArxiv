# 摘要

> 课外活动对学生教育体验的丰富至关重要。随着机器学习和自然语言处理的普及，利用ML-NLP优化课外活动成为AI研究的新焦点。本研究开发了一个机器学习流程，通过情感分析量化学生自组织活动的成效。我们采用BERT大型语言模型，通过pysentimiento工具包在Hugging Face中构建Transformer管道，分析了菲律宾College X的RSO——Organization C的数据样本。流程涵盖数据预处理、特征精选、LLM处理及评分汇总，为每项活动生成评分。研究显示，BERT LLM不仅适用于产品评论和帖子，还能有效分析更广泛的情感。此研究为教育机构的学生事务部门提供了一个NLP实际应用范例，突显了数据驱动决策的深远影响。

> Student extracurricular activities play an important role in enriching the students' educational experiences. With the increasing popularity of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, it becomes a logical step that incorporating ML-NLP in improving extracurricular activities is a potential focus of study in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This research study aims to develop a machine learning workflow that will quantify the effectiveness of student-organized activities based on student emotional responses using sentiment analysis. The study uses the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) Large Language Model (LLM) called via the pysentimiento toolkit, as a Transformer pipeline in Hugging Face. A sample data set from Organization C, a Recognized Student Organization (RSO) of a higher educational institute in the Philippines, College X, was used to develop the workflow. The workflow consisted of data preprocessing, key feature selection, LLM feature processing, and score aggregation, resulting in an Event Score for each data set. The results show that the BERT LLM can also be used effectively in analyzing sentiment beyond product reviews and post comments. For the student affairs offices of educational institutions, this study can provide a practical example of how NLP can be applied to real-world scenarios, showcasing the potential impact of data-driven decision making.
