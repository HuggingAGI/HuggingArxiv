# 摘要

> 随着6G时代连接设备的激增，特别是在智能农业和智能城市等大规模接入场景中，传统通信方式面临巨大挑战。幸运的是，人工智能的蓬勃发展和设备计算能力的提升为6G带来了希望——语义通信（SemCom）。然而，现有基于深度学习的SemCom模式因端到端训练的僵化，难以适应多用户环境。为此，本文重新构想了多用户系统中的生成式SemCom，并引入多模态大型语言模型（MLLM），提出创新框架“M2GSC”。在该框架中，MLLM作为共享知识库，在处理复杂任务时发挥关键作用，推动语义编码标准化和解码个性化。此外，我们提出了三个研究方向以优化M2GSC框架，并促进其在6G中的应用。最后，通过案例研究展示了M2GSC框架在简化解码卸载方面的初步成效。

> The surge in connected devices in 6G with typical massive access scenarios, such as smart agriculture, and smart cities, poses significant challenges to unsustainable traditional communication with limited radio resources and already high system complexity. Fortunately, the booming artificial intelligence technology and the growing computational power of devices offer a promising 6G enabler: semantic communication (SemCom). However, existing deep learning-based SemCom paradigms struggle to extend to multi-user scenarios due to their rigid end-to-end training approach. Consequently, to truly empower 6G networks with this critical technology, this article rethinks generative SemCom for multi-user system with multi-modal large language model (MLLM), and propose a novel framework called "M2GSC". In this framework, the MLLM, which serves as shared knowledge base (SKB), plays three critical roles for complex tasks, spawning a series of benefits such as semantic encoding standardization and semantic decoding personalization. Meanwhile, to enhance the performance of M2GSC framework and to advance its implementation in 6G, we highlight three research directions on M2GSC framework, namely, upgrading SKB to closed loop agent, adaptive semantic encoding offloading, and streamlined semantic decoding offloading. Finally, a case study is conducted to demonstrate the preliminary validation on the effectiveness of the M2GSC framework in terms of streamlined decoding offloading.
