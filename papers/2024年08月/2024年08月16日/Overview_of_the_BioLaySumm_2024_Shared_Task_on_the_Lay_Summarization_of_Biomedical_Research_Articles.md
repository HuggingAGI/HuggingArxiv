# 摘要

> 本文详述了ACL 2024 BioNLP研讨会上第二届BioLaySumm共享任务的成果，该任务专注于生物医学研究文章的通俗摘要。我们旨在通过激发更多研究兴趣和鼓励创新方法，进一步推动这一领域的发展。令人振奋的是，本次任务吸引了53支团队，参与度大幅提升。结果表明，参与者广泛采纳了创新策略，并逐渐倾向于使用大型语言模型（LLMs）。

> This paper presents the setup and results of the second edition of the BioLaySumm shared task on the Lay Summarisation of Biomedical Research Articles, hosted at the BioNLP Workshop at ACL 2024. In this task edition, we aim to build on the first edition's success by further increasing research interest in this important task and encouraging participants to explore novel approaches that will help advance the state-of-the-art. Encouragingly, we found research interest in the task to be high, with this edition of the task attracting a total of 53 participating teams, a significant increase in engagement from the previous edition. Overall, our results show that a broad range of innovative approaches were adopted by task participants, with a predictable shift towards the use of Large Language Models (LLMs).
