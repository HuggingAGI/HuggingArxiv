# 摘要

> 我们推出了EXAONE 3.0，这是LG AI Research开发的首个开放式大型语言模型。我们公开发布了7.8B版本的指令调整模型，旨在推动开放研究和创新。在广泛的评估中，EXAONE 3.0在实际应用中展现出与同类顶尖模型相媲美的性能，尤其在韩语处理上表现突出，同时在通用任务和复杂推理中也表现出色。凭借其卓越的实际应用效果和双语能力，我们期待EXAONE继续推动专家AI领域的发展。EXAONE 3.0模型现已开放，可访问https://huggingface.co/LGAI-EXAONE/EXAONE-3.0-7.8B-Instruct获取。

> We introduce EXAONE 3.0 instruction-tuned language model, the first open model in the family of Large Language Models (LLMs) developed by LG AI Research. Among different model sizes, we publicly release the 7.8B instruction-tuned model to promote open research and innovations. Through extensive evaluations across a wide range of public and in-house benchmarks, EXAONE 3.0 demonstrates highly competitive real-world performance with instruction-following capability against other state-of-the-art open models of similar size. Our comparative analysis shows that EXAONE 3.0 excels particularly in Korean, while achieving compelling performance across general tasks and complex reasoning. With its strong real-world effectiveness and bilingual proficiency, we hope that EXAONE keeps contributing to advancements in Expert AI.
