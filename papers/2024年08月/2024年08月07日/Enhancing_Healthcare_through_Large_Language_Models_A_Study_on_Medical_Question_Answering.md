> Enhancing Healthcare through Large Language Models: A Study on Medical Question Answering

# 摘要

> 近年来，LLM 在医疗领域的应用前景广阔，有助于提升医疗知识的普及与传播。本文深入探讨了基于 MedQuAD 数据集训练的多种 LLM，旨在找出最擅长提供精准医疗信息的模型。实验结果显示，Sentence-t5 与 Mistral 7B 的组合模型表现卓越，精确度高达 0.762。这一成就得益于其尖端的预训练技术、稳固的架构设计及高效的提示策略。Sentence-t5 + Mistral 7B 模型凭借这些优势，在解析与生成精确医疗答案方面尤为出色。研究结果表明，将先进的 LLM 技术融入医疗场景，能有效提升医疗知识检索的效率与准确性，进而加强患者教育与支持。

> In recent years, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare has shown significant promise in improving the accessibility and dissemination of medical knowledge. This paper presents a detailed study of various LLMs trained on the MedQuAD medical question-answering dataset, with a focus on identifying the most effective model for providing accurate medical information. Among the models tested, the Sentence-t5 combined with Mistral 7B demonstrated superior performance, achieving a precision score of 0.762. This model's enhanced capabilities are attributed to its advanced pretraining techniques, robust architecture, and effective prompt construction methodologies. By leveraging these strengths, the Sentence-t5 + Mistral 7B model excels in understanding and generating precise medical answers. Our findings highlight the potential of integrating sophisticated LLMs in medical contexts to facilitate efficient and accurate medical knowledge retrieval, thus significantly enhancing patient education and support.
