# 摘要

> 跨学科合作是解决复杂科学问题的关键。大型语言模型（LLM）的进步为各领域研究者带来了巨大潜力。我们分析了OpenAlex平台上的50,391篇论文，以探索LLM在科学领域的应用及其对跨学科合作的影响。通过香农熵评估，我们发现ChatGPT发布后，多数领域的协作多样性有所增加，尤其是计算机科学。其他领域如社会科学、决策科学等也显示出熵的增加。统计分析显示，计算机科学等领域的熵低于医学等健康领域。网络分析揭示了计算机科学、医学等部门在LLM研究中的重要性，以及斯坦福大学、哈佛大学等机构的关键作用。本研究深入剖析了LLM研究中合作网络的现状与动态。

> Interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial for addressing complex scientific challenges. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in benefiting researchers across various fields. To explore the application of LLMs in scientific disciplines and their implications for interdisciplinary collaboration, we collect and analyze 50,391 papers from OpenAlex, an open-source platform for scholarly metadata. We first employ Shannon entropy to assess the diversity of collaboration in terms of authors' institutions and departments. Our results reveal that most fields have exhibited varying degrees of increased entropy following the release of ChatGPT, with Computer Science displaying a consistent increase. Other fields such as Social Science, Decision Science, Psychology, Engineering, Health Professions, and Business, Management & Accounting have shown minor to significant increases in entropy in 2024 compared to 2023. Statistical testing further indicates that the entropy in Computer Science, Decision Science, and Engineering is significantly lower than that in health-related fields like Medicine and Biochemistry, Genetics & Molecular Biology. In addition, our network analysis based on authors' affiliation information highlights the prominence of Computer Science, Medicine, and other Computer Science-related departments in LLM research. Regarding authors' institutions, our analysis reveals that entities such as Stanford University, Harvard University, University College London, and Google are key players, either dominating centrality measures or playing crucial roles in connecting research networks. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the current landscape and evolving dynamics of collaboration networks in LLM research.
