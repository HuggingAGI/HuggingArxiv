# 摘要

> 社交情境中的情绪识别复杂且需整合多源信息。传统方法多关注去情境化信号，而新研究强调上下文的重要性。本文利用心理学理论，为基于上下文的情绪识别领域贡献新思路。我们提出结合情绪识别与贝叶斯线索整合（BCI）的方法，整合面部表情与上下文知识。在囚徒困境任务中测试，结果显示BCI在多种自动识别方法中表现出色，最佳方法甚至媲美人类观察者，预示着该方法在情感计算领域的潜力。

> Emotion recognition in social situations is a complex task that requires integrating information from both facial expressions and the situational context. While traditional approaches to automatic emotion recognition have focused on decontextualized signals, recent research emphasizes the importance of context in shaping emotion perceptions. This paper contributes to the emerging field of context-based emotion recognition by leveraging psychological theories of human emotion perception to inform the design of automated methods. We propose an approach that combines emotion recognition methods with Bayesian Cue Integration (BCI) to integrate emotion inferences from decontextualized facial expressions and contextual knowledge inferred via Large-language Models. We test this approach in the context of interpreting facial expressions during a social task, the prisoner's dilemma. Our results provide clear support for BCI across a range of automatic emotion recognition methods. The best automated method achieved results comparable to human observers, suggesting the potential for this approach to advance the field of affective computing.
