> Wiping out the limitations of Large Language Models -- A Taxonomy for Retrieval Augmented Generation

# 摘要

> 当前RAG研究跨足多学科，技术飞速进步，但焦点多在技术创新而非商业应用。为此，我们旨在构建一个分类框架，全面梳理RAG应用的核心特征，助力其在信息系统领域的推广。目前，尚未有针对RAG应用的分类体系。我们的方法论详述了论文筛选标准，以及为何采用LLM辅助手段提取初始特征，并简述了构建分类的系统流程。该流程历经四轮迭代，不断优化我们对RAG关键维度的认识与表述。我们最终确立了五个元维度和十六个维度，全方位涵盖RAG应用的内涵。在成果阐述中，我们不仅聚焦特定研究领域，还提出关键问题，引领未来信息系统研究者深入探索RAG系统的新兴议题。

> Current research on RAGs is distributed across various disciplines, and since the technology is evolving very quickly, its unit of analysis is mostly on technological innovations, rather than applications in business contexts. Thus, in this research, we aim to create a taxonomy to conceptualize a comprehensive overview of the constituting characteristics that define RAG applications, facilitating the adoption of this technology in the IS community. To the best of our knowledge, no RAG application taxonomies have been developed so far. We describe our methodology for developing the taxonomy, which includes the criteria for selecting papers, an explanation of our rationale for employing a Large Language Model (LLM)-supported approach to extract and identify initial characteristics, and a concise overview of our systematic process for conceptualizing the taxonomy. Our systematic taxonomy development process includes four iterative phases designed to refine and enhance our understanding and presentation of RAG's core dimensions. We have developed a total of five meta-dimensions and sixteen dimensions to comprehensively capture the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. When discussing our findings, we also detail the specific research areas and pose key research questions to guide future information system researchers as they explore the emerging topics of RAG systems.
