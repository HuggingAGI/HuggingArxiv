> AgentsCoMerge: Large Language Model Empowered Collaborative Decision Making for Ramp Merging

# 摘要

> 坡道合并是交通系统的一大难题，常引发拥堵、事故和严重碳排放。为此，我们创新性地提出了AgentsCoMerge框架，旨在提升多车道合并区自动驾驶车辆的安全与效率。该框架通过场景观察与理解模块捕捉交通环境，利用分层规划模块进行决策与轨迹规划，并通过通信模块促进多代理间的信息交流与行动协调。此外，我们还引入了强化反思训练，以提升决策质量。实验结果显示，我们的方法在多种坡道合并场景中表现出色，有效提升了多代理协同决策的效率与效果。

> Ramp merging is one of the bottlenecks in traffic systems, which commonly cause traffic congestion, accidents, and severe carbon emissions. In order to address this essential issue and enhance the safety and efficiency of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) at multi-lane merging zones, we propose a novel collaborative decision-making framework, named AgentsCoMerge, to leverage large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we first design a scene observation and understanding module to allow an agent to capture the traffic environment. Then we propose a hierarchical planning module to enable the agent to make decisions and plan trajectories based on the observation and the agent's own state. In addition, in order to facilitate collaboration among multiple agents, we introduce a communication module to enable the surrounding agents to exchange necessary information and coordinate their actions. Finally, we develop a reinforcement reflection guided training paradigm to further enhance the decision-making capability of the framework. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed method, demonstrating its superior efficiency and effectiveness for multi-agent collaborative decision-making under various ramp merging scenarios.
