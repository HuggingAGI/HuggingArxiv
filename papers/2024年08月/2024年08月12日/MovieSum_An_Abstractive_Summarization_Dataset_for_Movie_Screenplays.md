> MovieSum: An Abstractive Summarization Dataset for Movie Screenplays

# 摘要

> 电影剧本摘要化充满挑战，因其需深入理解长篇内容及电影特有元素。尽管大型语言模型在文档摘要领域进步显著，但处理长篇输入仍显吃力。电视转录本虽受研究关注，电影剧本摘要却鲜有涉猎。为此，我们推出新数据集MovieSum，专为电影剧本抽象摘要设计。包含2200部剧本及维基剧情摘要，我们精心调整剧本格式以凸显结构特色。相较现有数据集，MovieSum独具匠心：收录更长电影剧本，规模翻倍，并附IMDb ID元数据，便于链接外部知识。同时，我们运用最新大型语言模型，于该数据集上展现摘要成果，奠定坚实研究基石。

> Movie screenplay summarization is challenging, as it requires an understanding of long input contexts and various elements unique to movies. Large language models have shown significant advancements in document summarization, but they often struggle with processing long input contexts. Furthermore, while television transcripts have received attention in recent studies, movie screenplay summarization remains underexplored. To stimulate research in this area, we present a new dataset, MovieSum, for abstractive summarization of movie screenplays. This dataset comprises 2200 movie screenplays accompanied by their Wikipedia plot summaries. We manually formatted the movie screenplays to represent their structural elements. Compared to existing datasets, MovieSum possesses several distinctive features: (1) It includes movie screenplays, which are longer than scripts of TV episodes. (2) It is twice the size of previous movie screenplay datasets. (3) It provides metadata with IMDb IDs to facilitate access to additional external knowledge. We also show the results of recently released large language models applied to summarization on our dataset to provide a detailed baseline.
