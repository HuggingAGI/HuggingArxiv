> The AI Scientist: Towards Fully Automated Open-Ended Scientific Discovery

# 摘要

> 人工通用智能的一大挑战是培养能够自主进行科学研究、发现新知的智能体。尽管前沿AI模型已辅助人类科学家进行创意激发、代码编写或预测等任务，但它们仅触及科学探索的冰山一角。本文首次提出全自动科学发现的综合框架，赋予前沿大型语言模型独立研究与成果交流的能力。我们推出的“AI科学家”，不仅能孕育创新研究思路、编码实验、结果可视化，还能撰写完整科学论文，并通过模拟评审自我评估。这一过程可循环往复，以开放式迭代推动想法进化，宛如人类科学社群的缩影。我们将其应用于机器学习的三个子领域——扩散模型、Transformer语言模型及学习动力学，每项研究成果转化为论文的成本低于15美元。为确保论文质量，我们设计了自动化评审系统，其评分准确度接近人类水平。经此系统评判，“AI科学家”所产论文已达到顶级机器学习会议的录取标准。这一创新方法开启了机器学习领域科学发现的新纪元，将AI的变革力量注入AI研究的全过程，引领我们迈向一个以低成本释放无限创造力与创新、攻克全球难题的未来。相关代码已公开于https://github.com/SakanaAI/AI-Scientist。

> One of the grand challenges of artificial general intelligence is developing agents capable of conducting scientific research and discovering new knowledge. While frontier models have already been used as aids to human scientists, e.g. for brainstorming ideas, writing code, or prediction tasks, they still conduct only a small part of the scientific process. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling frontier large language models to perform research independently and communicate their findings. We introduce The AI Scientist, which generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results, describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs a simulated review process for evaluation. In principle, this process can be repeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion, acting like the human scientific community. We demonstrate its versatility by applying it to three distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling, transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics. Each idea is implemented and developed into a full paper at a cost of less than $15 per paper. To evaluate the generated papers, we design and validate an automated reviewer, which we show achieves near-human performance in evaluating paper scores. The AI Scientist can produce papers that exceed the acceptance threshold at a top machine learning conference as judged by our automated reviewer. This approach signifies the beginning of a new era in scientific discovery in machine learning: bringing the transformative benefits of AI agents to the entire research process of AI itself, and taking us closer to a world where endless affordable creativity and innovation can be unleashed on the world's most challenging problems.
