> 确保软件项目成功的关键在于融合开发者与用户的视角。尽管海量用户数据来源广泛，但其有效利用仍是一大难题。为此，我们推出了DeeperMatcher这一LLM驱动方案，助力敏捷团队在问题与任务管理中运用基于人群的需求工程（CrowdRE）。我们正开发一款命令行工具，让开发者能精准匹配问题与用户反馈。通过在知名开源项目的英语数据集上验证，以及与巴西葡萄牙语项目的开发者合作进行实验，我们发现方法的准确性深受文本嵌入技术影响。未来，我们将致力于提升多语言环境下的基于人群需求工程的可靠性。

> A central challenge for ensuring the success of software projects is to assure the convergence of developers' and users' views. While the availability of large amounts of user data from social media, app store reviews, and support channels bears many benefits, it still remains unclear how software development teams can effectively use this data. We present an LLM-powered approach called DeeperMatcher that helps agile teams use crowd-based requirements engineering (CrowdRE) in their issue and task management. We are currently implementing a command-line tool that enables developers to match issues with relevant user reviews. We validated our approach on an existing English dataset from a well-known open-source project. Additionally, to check how well DeeperMatcher works for other languages, we conducted a single-case mechanism experiment alongside developers of a local project that has issues and user feedback in Brazilian Portuguese. Our preliminary analysis indicates that the accuracy of our approach is highly dependent on the text embedding method used. We discuss further refinements needed for reliable crowd-based requirements engineering with multilingual support.
