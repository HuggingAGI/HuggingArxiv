# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLMs）凭借其卓越的内容生成和推理能力，能够模拟人类反应。然而，如何利用LLMs进行现场实验模拟仍是一个未解之谜。本文提出并评估了两种创新提示策略：观察者模式直接预测主要结论，参与者模式则模拟参与者的反应分布。我们分析了INFORMS和MISQ上十五篇高引用的现场实验论文，发现模拟结果与实际结果在特定情境下高度吻合。同时，我们也指出了LLMs在性别差异和社会规范研究方面的不足。本文提出的自动化和标准化流程，为大规模筛选包含现场实验的论文提供了可能。通过引入观察者和参与者模式，我们展示了LLMs在复杂现场环境中预测和复制反应的能力，实现了66%的模拟准确率。这项研究不仅拓宽了LLMs的应用领域，还为研究人员在进行实地实验前提供了有力辅助，并警示了LLMs在模拟现场实验中的局限性。

> Prevailing large language models (LLMs) are capable of human responses simulation through its unprecedented content generation and reasoning abilities. However, it is not clear whether and how to leverage LLMs to simulate field experiments. In this paper, we propose and evaluate two prompting strategies: the observer mode that allows a direct prediction on main conclusions and the participant mode that simulates distributions of responses from participants. Using this approach, we examine fifteen well cited field experimental papers published in INFORMS and MISQ, finding encouraging alignments between simulated experimental results and the actual results in certain scenarios. We further identify topics of which LLMs underperform, including gender difference and social norms related research. Additionally, the automatic and standardized workflow proposed in this paper enables the possibility of a large-scale screening of more papers with field experiments. This paper pioneers the utilization of large language models (LLMs) for simulating field experiments, presenting a significant extension to previous work which focused solely on lab environments. By introducing two novel prompting strategies, observer and participant modes, we demonstrate the ability of LLMs to both predict outcomes and replicate participant responses within complex field settings. Our findings indicate a promising alignment with actual experimental results in certain scenarios, achieving a stimulation accuracy of 66% in observer mode. This study expands the scope of potential applications for LLMs and illustrates their utility in assisting researchers prior to engaging in expensive field experiments. Moreover, it sheds light on the boundaries of LLMs when used in simulating field experiments, serving as a cautionary note for researchers considering the integration of LLMs into their experimental toolkit.
