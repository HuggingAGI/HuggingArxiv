> Grammatical Error Feedback: An Implicit Evaluation Approach

# 摘要

> 语法反馈在第二语言学习中扮演着关键角色。然而，多数研究偏重于通过语法错误纠正系统提供反馈，忽视了更全面的反馈方式。本文引入了一种创新的隐式评估方法，无需人工注释，通过语法排列法，让大型语言模型从多个选项中匹配反馈与文章。这一过程中，干扰项的选择尤为关键。我们利用此框架，分析了语法错误纠正系统的反馈质量和必要性，以及生成反馈的系统本身，研究素材来自剑桥学习者语料库。

> Grammatical feedback is crucial for consolidating second language (L2) learning. Most research in computer-assisted language learning has focused on feedback through grammatical error correction (GEC) systems, rather than examining more holistic feedback that may be more useful for learners. This holistic feedback will be referred to as grammatical error feedback (GEF). In this paper, we present a novel implicit evaluation approach to GEF that eliminates the need for manual feedback annotations. Our method adopts a grammatical lineup approach where the task is to pair feedback and essay representations from a set of possible alternatives. This matching process can be performed by appropriately prompting a large language model (LLM). An important aspect of this process, explored here, is the form of the lineup, i.e., the selection of foils. This paper exploits this framework to examine the quality and need for GEC to generate feedback, as well as the system used to generate feedback, using essays from the Cambridge Learner Corpus.
