> Does Thought Require Sensory Grounding? From Pure Thinkers to Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 思考是否必须依赖感知？这一辩论在哲学史上经久不衰，如今在人工智能领域也引发热议。我主张，理论上存在纯粹的思考者，它们无需任何感知能力。同时，我也指出，缺乏感知能力会极大限制思考的深度与广度。在人工智能方面，我并不直接断言大型语言模型具备思考或理解的能力，但我反驳了“感知基础论”这一重要观点。此外，我借助最新的语言模型研究成果，探讨了感知基础如何影响认知能力的问题。

> Does the capacity to think require the capacity to sense? A lively debate on this topic runs throughout the history of philosophy and now animates discussions of artificial intelligence. I argue that in principle, there can be pure thinkers: thinkers that lack the capacity to sense altogether. I also argue for significant limitations in just what sort of thought is possible in the absence of the capacity to sense. Regarding AI, I do not argue directly that large language models can think or understand, but I rebut one important argument (the argument from sensory grounding) that they cannot. I also use recent results regarding language models to address the question of whether or how sensory grounding enhances cognitive capacities.
