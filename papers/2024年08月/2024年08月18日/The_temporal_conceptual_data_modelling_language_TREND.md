# 摘要

> 时间概念数据建模，作为EER和UML类图等传统建模语言的扩展，虽历经起伏，但近期在业务流程建模等领域因其对强大数据模型的需求而重获关注。然而，这些语言尚未经受建模者的可理解性和实用性考验，且其时间约束的选择与相关性仍不明朗。为此，我们深入探索了时间概念数据建模语言的表达潜力，通过小规模定性实验打造了迄今最富表达力的语言TREND，并在大规模实验中完善了其图形符号与应用理解。历经11项实验，汇聚千名参与者智慧，共创246个时间概念数据模型。研究发现，过渡约束的标签选择与语言解释的扩展影响甚微，但在受控自然语言中精准表达建模需求显著提升了模型质量。此外，实验暗示，为确保社区广泛采纳，对领域专家的针对性培训不可或缺。

> Temporal conceptual data modelling, as an extension to regular conceptual data modelling languages such as EER and UML class diagrams, has received intermittent attention across the decades. It is receiving renewed interest in the context of, among others, business process modelling that needs robust expressive data models to complement them. None of the proposed temporal conceptual data modelling languages have been tested on understandability and usability by modellers, however, nor is it clear which temporal constraints would be used by modellers or whether the ones included are the relevant temporal constraints. We therefore sought to investigate temporal representations in temporal conceptual data modelling languages, design a, to date, most expressive language, TREND, through small-scale qualitative experiments, and finalise the graphical notation and modelling and understanding in large scale experiments. This involved a series of 11 experiments with over a thousand participants in total, having created 246 temporal conceptual data models. Key outcomes are that choice of label for transition constraints had limited impact, as did extending explanations of the modelling language, but expressing what needs to be modelled in controlled natural language did improve model quality. The experiments also indicate that more training may be needed, in particular guidance for domain experts, to achieve adoption of temporal conceptual data modelling by the community.
