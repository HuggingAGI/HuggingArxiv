> 分析学生情绪与行为对提升学习成效和定制教育体验至关重要。传统手段依赖侵入式数据收集，引发隐私与扩展难题。本文创新地运用大型语言模型（LLM）与提示工程，通过文本分析学生情绪。我们设计专属提示，引导LLM识别情绪与参与度，实现非侵入且可扩展的解决方案。实验对比显示，我们的方法在准确性与上下文理解上大幅领先。此研究揭示了LLM与提示工程结合，为教育领域情绪与行为分析提供高效工具的潜力。

> The analysis of students' emotions and behaviors is crucial for enhancing learning outcomes and personalizing educational experiences. Traditional methods often rely on intrusive visual and physiological data collection, posing privacy concerns and scalability issues. This paper proposes a novel method leveraging large language models (LLMs) and prompt engineering to analyze textual data from students. Our approach utilizes tailored prompts to guide LLMs in detecting emotional and engagement states, providing a non-intrusive and scalable solution. We conducted experiments using Qwen, ChatGPT, Claude2, and GPT-4, comparing our method against baseline models and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines in both accuracy and contextual understanding. This study highlights the potential of LLMs combined with prompt engineering to offer practical and effective tools for educational emotion and behavior analysis.
