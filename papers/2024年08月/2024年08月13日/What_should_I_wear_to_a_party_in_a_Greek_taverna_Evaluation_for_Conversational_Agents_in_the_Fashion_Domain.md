# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLM）即将革新在线时尚零售业，提升客户在线体验和时尚探索。LLM支持的对话代理通过直接互动，开辟了新的发现途径，让客户能以个性化的方式表达需求，获得符合其品味和意图的时尚建议。在电商领域，如寻找特定商品时，对话代理需将互动转化为对后端系统的具体调用，如通过搜索系统展示相关商品。因此，评估LLM在调用服务方面的能力至关重要，但这类评估因缺乏高质量数据集而复杂，且与业务需求不完全契合。为此，我们构建了一个包含4000次对话的多语言数据集，用于评估LLM在客户与后端系统间充当助手的能力。我们测试了多种模型，展示了数据集如何适应业务需求，并推动工具的迭代发展。

> Large language models (LLMs) are poised to revolutionize the domain of online fashion retail, enhancing customer experience and discovery of fashion online. LLM-powered conversational agents introduce a new way of discovery by directly interacting with customers, enabling them to express in their own ways, refine their needs, obtain fashion and shopping advice that is relevant to their taste and intent. For many tasks in e-commerce, such as finding a specific product, conversational agents need to convert their interactions with a customer to a specific call to different backend systems, e.g., a search system to showcase a relevant set of products. Therefore, evaluating the capabilities of LLMs to perform those tasks related to calling other services is vital. However, those evaluations are generally complex, due to the lack of relevant and high quality datasets, and do not align seamlessly with business needs, amongst others. To this end, we created a multilingual evaluation dataset of 4k conversations between customers and a fashion assistant in a large e-commerce fashion platform to measure the capabilities of LLMs to serve as an assistant between customers and a backend engine. We evaluate a range of models, showcasing how our dataset scales to business needs and facilitates iterative development of tools.
