> Large Model Strategic Thinking, Small Model Efficiency: Transferring Theory of Mind in Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 随着更大、更新的语言模型在战略性心智理论（ToM）任务上的表现不断提升，对这些尖端模型的需求也随之增长。然而，这些模型的部署成本高昂，涉及大量的处理能力和时间。本文探讨了通过微调创建更小、适合模拟的代理的可行性。我们采用了一个结合社交背景和社会困境的20个独特场景的大型预训练模型，记录其答案，并用于对同一系列的小型模型进行问答微调。我们的研究聚焦于情境游戏理论决策，这一领域同样涉及人类互动，需要心智理论（或类似理论）和对社会动态的理解。结果显示，经过微调的小型语言模型在性能上显著接近其大型同类，且改进范围超出了训练示例的领域和情境。平均而言，通过微调，小型模型在匹配大型模型行为方面提升了46%，完全匹配为100%。这表明，我们的方法有效传递了心智理论给小型模型，创造了改进且成本效益高的可部署算法。尽管存在简单性和局限性，我们的研究为训练用于战略性和社会决策的专用模型奠定了基础。

> As the performance of larger, newer Large Language Models continues to improve for strategic Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks, the demand for these state of the art models increases commensurately. However, their deployment is costly both in terms of processing power and time. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of creating smaller, simulation-ready agents by way of fine-tuning. To do this, we present a large pre-trained model with 20 unique scenarios that combine a social context with a social dilemma, recording its answers, and using them for Q\&A fine-tuning on a smaller model of the same family. Our focus is on in-context game-theoretic decision-making, the same domain within which human interaction occurs and that requires both a theory of mind (or a semblance thereof) and an understanding of social dynamics. We find that the fine-tuned smaller language model exhibited significant performance closer to that of its larger relative, and that their improvements extended in areas and contexts beyond the ones provided in the training examples. On average for all games, through fine-tuning, the smaller model showed a \%46 improvement in aligning with the behavior of the larger model, with \%100 representing complete alignment. This suggests that our pipeline represents an efficient method to transmit some form of theory of mind to smaller models, creating improved and cheaply deployable algorithms in the process. Despite their simplicity and their associated shortcomings and limitations, our findings represent a stepping stone in the pursuit and training of specialized models for strategic and social decision making.
