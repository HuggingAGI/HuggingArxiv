> Neural embedding of beliefs reveals the role of relative dissonance in human decision-making

# 摘要

> 信念是人类认知与决策的基石，引导我们理解生活、塑造行为并建立社会联系。因此，一个能捕捉信念及其相互关系的模型对于量化信念对行为的影响至关重要。尽管其重要性，现有研究往往局限于特定问题的少数信念，且依赖于调查或实验。我们提出一种新方法，通过分析在线辩论平台的大规模用户数据，利用微调的大型语言模型（LLM）将数千信念映射至嵌入空间，揭示信念间的复杂关系及社会问题的极化现象。我们发现，信念空间中的位置能预测个体的新信念，且现有信念与新信念间的距离可量化认知失调，进而预测新信念。本研究展示了现代LLM结合人类信念在线记录的潜力，为理解人类信念形成与决策过程提供了新视角。

> Beliefs serve as the foundation for human cognition and decision-making. They guide individuals in deriving meaning from their lives, shaping their behaviors, and forming social connections. Therefore, a model that encapsulates beliefs and their interrelationships is crucial for quantitatively studying the influence of beliefs on our actions. Despite its importance, research on the interplay between human beliefs has often been limited to a small set of beliefs pertaining to specific issues, with a heavy reliance on surveys or experiments. Here, we propose a method for extracting nuanced relations between thousands of beliefs by leveraging large-scale user participation data from an online debate platform and mapping these beliefs to an embedding space using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM). This belief embedding space effectively encapsulates the interconnectedness of diverse beliefs as well as polarization across various social issues. We discover that the positions within this belief space predict new beliefs of individuals. Furthermore, we find that the relative distance between one's existing beliefs and new beliefs can serve as a quantitative estimate of cognitive dissonance, allowing us to predict new beliefs. Our study highlights how modern LLMs, when combined with collective online records of human beliefs, can offer insights into the fundamental principles that govern human belief formation and decision-making processes.
