# 摘要

> 全球数百万人的沟通依赖于替代性和辅助性沟通设备。视觉场景显示（VSDs）通过在情境化图像中嵌入沟通选项，有效提升了这些个体的沟通能力。然而，现有VSDs常使用默认图像，这些图像可能缺乏相关性或需手动配置，增加了沟通伙伴的负担。本研究探索了利用大型多模态模型（如GPT-4V）自动生成VSDs沟通选项的可行性。我们收集了LMM及语言病理学家与AAC研究人员的意见（共13人），并通过专家评估验证了这些选项。研究结果显示，LMM生成的沟通选项在情境上具有高度相关性，且与人类创建的选项相似。但要将LMM成功应用于AAC设备，还需解决一些关键问题。

> Millions of people worldwide rely on alternative and augmentative communication devices to communicate. Visual scene displays (VSDs) can enhance communication for these individuals by embedding communication options within contextualized images. However, existing VSDs often present default images that may lack relevance or require manual configuration, placing a significant burden on communication partners. In this study, we assess the feasibility of leveraging large multimodal models (LMM), such as GPT-4V, to automatically create communication options for VSDs. Communication options were sourced from a LMM and speech-language pathologists (SLPs) and AAC researchers (N=13) for evaluation through an expert assessment conducted by the SLPs and AAC researchers. We present the study's findings, supplemented by insights from semi-structured interviews (N=5) about SLP's and AAC researchers' opinions on the use of generative AI in augmentative and alternative communication devices. Our results indicate that the communication options generated by the LMM were contextually relevant and often resembled those created by humans. However, vital questions remain that must be addressed before LMMs can be confidently implemented in AAC devices.
