> Reconciling Methodological Paradigms: Employing Large Language Models as Novice Qualitative Research Assistants in Talent Management Research

# 摘要

> 通过访谈和焦点小组等定性数据收集与分析方法，我们能深入了解客户的态度、情感和行为。然而，手动分析这些数据既耗时又费力。为此，本研究提出了一种创新方法，利用基于RAG的LLM来自动分析访谈记录，将LLM视为新手研究助理，增强研究过程。我们探索了LLM在人才管理领域作为定性研究助理的潜力，并展示了RAG-LLM在半结构化访谈数据主题建模中的应用，超越了传统信息检索的范畴。研究结果显示，LLM-RAG方法能有效提取主题，覆盖范围广。为确保研究质量，我们建议借鉴传统定性研究的质量标准。此外，本文还为行业实践者提供了将LLM与定性研究范式结合的实用指南，助力这些AI工具在定性数据分析中的有效应用。

> Qualitative data collection and analysis approaches, such as those employing interviews and focus groups, provide rich insights into customer attitudes, sentiment, and behavior. However, manually analyzing qualitative data requires extensive time and effort to identify relevant topics and thematic insights. This study proposes a novel approach to address this challenge by leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based Large Language Models (LLMs) for analyzing interview transcripts. The novelty of this work lies in strategizing the research inquiry as one that is augmented by an LLM that serves as a novice research assistant. This research explores the mental model of LLMs to serve as novice qualitative research assistants for researchers in the talent management space. A RAG-based LLM approach is extended to enable topic modeling of semi-structured interview data, showcasing the versatility of these models beyond their traditional use in information retrieval and search. Our findings demonstrate that the LLM-augmented RAG approach can successfully extract topics of interest, with significant coverage compared to manually generated topics from the same dataset. This establishes the viability of employing LLMs as novice qualitative research assistants. Additionally, the study recommends that researchers leveraging such models lean heavily on quality criteria used in traditional qualitative research to ensure rigor and trustworthiness of their approach. Finally, the paper presents key recommendations for industry practitioners seeking to reconcile the use of LLMs with established qualitative research paradigms, providing a roadmap for the effective integration of these powerful, albeit novice, AI tools in the analysis of qualitative datasets within talent
