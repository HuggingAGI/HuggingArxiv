> ISLES 2024: The first longitudinal multimodal multi-center real-world dataset in (sub-)acute stroke

# 摘要

> 中风是全球健康的一大威胁，不仅影响患者生命质量，还给社会经济带来沉重负担。近年来，随着血管内再灌注疗法和影像技术的进步，如CT和MRI的应用，患者预后有了显著改善。为了进一步推动临床和科研，我们需要能够从中风影像中提取有效脑功能模型的机器学习算法。为此，大型、多样且标注精细的公共数据集不可或缺。虽然过去这类数据集稀缺，但近期已有多个高质量数据集开放。然而，这些数据集仅限于MRI资料。我们的数据集则开创先河，提供了包括急性CT、血管造影、灌注成像，以及后续MRI和长达三个月的临床数据在内的全面纵向资料。该数据集分为150个训练样本和100个测试样本，训练数据公开，测试数据用于模型验证。我们通过2024年ISLES挑战赛（https://www.isles-challenge.org/）发布此数据集，旨在推动急性及亚急性中风病灶分割技术的基准建立，促进开放数据集的创建，并评估前沿图像处理算法。

> Stroke remains a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality, placing a heavy socioeconomic burden. Over the past decade, advances in endovascular reperfusion therapy and the use of CT and MRI imaging for treatment guidance have significantly improved patient outcomes and are now standard in clinical practice. To develop machine learning algorithms that can extract meaningful and reproducible models of brain function for both clinical and research purposes from stroke images - particularly for lesion identification, brain health quantification, and prognosis - large, diverse, and well-annotated public datasets are essential. While only a few datasets with (sub-)acute stroke data were previously available, several large, high-quality datasets have recently been made publicly accessible. However, these existing datasets include only MRI data. In contrast, our dataset is the first to offer comprehensive longitudinal stroke data, including acute CT imaging with angiography and perfusion, follow-up MRI at 2-9 days, as well as acute and longitudinal clinical data up to a three-month outcome. The dataset includes a training dataset of n = 150 and a test dataset of n = 100 scans. Training data is publicly available, while test data will be used exclusively for model validation. We are making this dataset available as part of the 2024 edition of the Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation (ISLES) challenge (https://www.isles-challenge.org/), which continuously aims to establish benchmark methods for acute and sub-acute ischemic stroke lesion segmentation, aiding in creating open stroke imaging datasets and evaluating cutting-edge image processing algorithms.
