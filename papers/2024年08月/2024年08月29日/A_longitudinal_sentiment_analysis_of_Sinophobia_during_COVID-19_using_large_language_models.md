> A longitudinal sentiment analysis of Sinophobia during COVID-19 using large language models

# 摘要

> COVID-19 疫情加剧了对华人的偏见，导致华裔遭受广泛歧视。大型语言模型 (LLM) 因其理解和生成类人文本的能力，特别适用于分析社交媒体情感。我们利用 LLM 构建了一个纵向情感分析框架，分析了疫情期间 Twitter 上的排华情绪。研究发现，排华推文、情绪与疫情病例激增密切相关，显示疫情发展影响了公众情绪和排华言论的流行。此外，分析揭示了负面情绪的主导地位，如烦恼和否认，凸显了政治叙事和错误信息对公众意见的影响。先前研究中缺乏的同理心情感，突显了媒体如何看待疫情并归咎于华人社区。本研究强调，在全球危机中，透明沟通对于缓解排外情绪至关重要。

> The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated xenophobia, particularly Sinophobia, leading to widespread discrimination against individuals of Chinese descent. Large language models (LLMs) are pre-trained deep learning models used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The ability of LLMs to understand and generate human-like text makes them particularly useful for analysing social media data to detect and evaluate sentiments. We present a sentiment analysis framework utilising LLMs for longitudinal sentiment analysis of the Sinophobic sentiments expressed in X (Twitter) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show a significant correlation between the spikes in Sinophobic tweets, Sinophobic sentiments and surges in COVID-19 cases, revealing that the evolution of the pandemic influenced public sentiment and the prevalence of Sinophobic discourse. Furthermore, the sentiment analysis revealed a predominant presence of negative sentiments, such as annoyance and denial, which underscores the impact of political narratives and misinformation shaping public opinion. The lack of empathetic sentiment which was present in previous studies related to COVID-19 highlights the way the political narratives in media viewed the pandemic and how it blamed the Chinese community. Our study highlights the importance of transparent communication in mitigating xenophobic sentiments during global crises.
