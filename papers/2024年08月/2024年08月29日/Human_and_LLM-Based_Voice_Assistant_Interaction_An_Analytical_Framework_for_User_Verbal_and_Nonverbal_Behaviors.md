> Human and LLM-Based Voice Assistant Interaction: An Analytical Framework for User Verbal and Nonverbal Behaviors

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型技术的进步大幅提升了人与语音助手的交互体验。本研究聚焦于用户在复杂烹饪任务中与LLM语音助手的持续互动。我们发现，即使知道助手无法感知，用户仍展现出丰富的语言与非语言行为。为此，我们构建了一个三维分析框架，涵盖行为特征、交互阶段及阶段转换，旨在深入解析这些互动，并为未来优化人机交互提供理论支持。

> Recent progress in large language model (LLM) technology has significantly enhanced the interaction experience between humans and voice assistants (VAs). This project aims to explore a user's continuous interaction with LLM-based VA (LLM-VA) during a complex task. We recruited 12 participants to interact with an LLM-VA during a cooking task, selected for its complexity and the requirement for continuous interaction. We observed that users show both verbal and nonverbal behaviors, though they know that the LLM-VA can not capture those nonverbal signals. Despite the prevalence of nonverbal behavior in human-human communication, there is no established analytical methodology or framework for exploring it in human-VA interactions. After analyzing 3 hours and 39 minutes of video recordings, we developed an analytical framework with three dimensions: 1) behavior characteristics, including both verbal and nonverbal behaviors, 2) interaction stages--exploration, conflict, and integration--that illustrate the progression of user interactions, and 3) stage transition throughout the task. This analytical framework identifies key verbal and nonverbal behaviors that provide a foundation for future research and practical applications in optimizing human and LLM-VA interactions.
