> People over trust AI-generated medical responses and view them to be as valid as doctors, despite low accuracy

# 摘要

> 本文深入探讨了非专业人士对AI生成医疗建议的感知与评估。研究发现，300名参与者难以区分AI与医生撰写的医疗回复，且更偏爱AI生成的内容，尤其是高准确性的AI回复，被认为更为可靠和满意。即便低准确性的AI回复，其表现也与医生回复相当，甚至更受信任，可能导致不必要的医疗行为。此外，当AI回复被误传为医生所写时，信任度更高，显示了信息来源不明确时的评估偏差。专家与非专家均倾向于认为AI回复更详尽准确，但仍强调医生在医疗建议中的重要性。未来，AI在医疗领域的应用应确保与医疗专业人员的紧密合作。

> This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of how AI-generated medical responses are perceived and evaluated by non-experts. A total of 300 participants gave evaluations for medical responses that were either written by a medical doctor on an online healthcare platform, or generated by a large language model and labeled by physicians as having high or low accuracy. Results showed that participants could not effectively distinguish between AI-generated and Doctors' responses and demonstrated a preference for AI-generated responses, rating High Accuracy AI-generated responses as significantly more valid, trustworthy, and complete/satisfactory. Low Accuracy AI-generated responses on average performed very similar to Doctors' responses, if not more. Participants not only found these low-accuracy AI-generated responses to be valid, trustworthy, and complete/satisfactory but also indicated a high tendency to follow the potentially harmful medical advice and incorrectly seek unnecessary medical attention as a result of the response provided. This problematic reaction was comparable if not more to the reaction they displayed towards doctors' responses. This increased trust placed on inaccurate or inappropriate AI-generated medical advice can lead to misdiagnosis and harmful consequences for individuals seeking help. Further, participants were more trusting of High Accuracy AI-generated responses when told they were given by a doctor and experts rated AI-generated responses significantly higher when the source of the response was unknown. Both experts and non-experts exhibited bias, finding AI-generated responses to be more thorough and accurate than Doctors' responses but still valuing the involvement of a Doctor in the delivery of their medical advice. Ensuring AI systems are implemented with medical professionals should be the future of using AI for the delivery of medical advice.
