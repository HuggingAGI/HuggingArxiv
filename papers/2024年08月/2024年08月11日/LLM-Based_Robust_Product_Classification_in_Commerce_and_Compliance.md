> LLM-Based Robust Product Classification in Commerce and Compliance

# 摘要

> 在国际贸易中，产品分类至关重要，因为它决定了合规性检查和税费的适用。手动分类既耗时又易错，面对海量进出口商品，手动方法已不切实际。因此，电商和跨国企业纷纷采用机器学习进行自动分类。但现有方法忽视了现实挑战，如产品描述的简略与残缺。近期，大型语言模型（LLMs）的生成与推理能力在分类领域尚未得到充分应用。本研究直面工业分类的实际难题，提出数据扰动技术以模拟真实数据。同时，我们利用LLM进行产品分类，增强不完整数据下的预测稳定性。研究发现，在无干扰数据环境下，LLM结合上下文学习的表现超越传统监督学习。更关键的是，面对数据攻击，LLM展现出远超监督方法的稳健性。

> Product classification is a crucial task in international trade, as compliance regulations are verified and taxes and duties are applied based on product categories. Manual classification of products is time-consuming and error-prone, and the sheer volume of products imported and exported renders the manual process infeasible. Consequently, e-commerce platforms and enterprises involved in international trade have turned to automatic product classification using machine learning. However, current approaches do not consider the real-world challenges associated with product classification, such as very abbreviated and incomplete product descriptions. In addition, recent advancements in generative Large Language Models (LLMs) and their reasoning capabilities are mainly untapped in product classification and e-commerce. In this research, we explore the real-life challenges of industrial classification and we propose data perturbations that allow for realistic data simulation. Furthermore, we employ LLM-based product classification to improve the robustness of the prediction in presence of incomplete data. Our research shows that LLMs with in-context learning outperform the supervised approaches in the clean-data scenario. Additionally, we illustrate that LLMs are significantly more robust than the supervised approaches when data attacks are present.
