# 摘要

> 本章探讨规则挖掘，从规则质量的度量等基础背景入手，进而将规则挖掘方法分为归纳逻辑编程、路径采样与泛化及线性编程三类。深入研究神经符号方法，涉及深度学习与规则的融合、嵌入技术在规则学习中的运用，以及大型语言模型在规则学习领域的应用。

> In this chapter, we address the problem of rule mining, beginning with essential background information, including measures of rule quality. We then explore various rule mining methodologies, categorized into three groups: inductive logic programming, path sampling and generalization, and linear programming. Following this, we delve into neurosymbolic methods, covering topics such as the integration of deep learning with rules, the use of embeddings for rule learning, and the application of large language models in rule learning.
