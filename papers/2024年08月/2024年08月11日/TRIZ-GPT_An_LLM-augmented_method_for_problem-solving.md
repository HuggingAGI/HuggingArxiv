> TRIZ-GPT: An LLM-augmented method for problem-solving

# 摘要

> TRIZ理论，源于跨领域专利的深入分析，为问题解决提供了框架和工具。尽管TRIZ潜力巨大，但其复杂性和抽象性常使学习和应用变得棘手，需要深厚的理论基础和跨学科经验。大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现，通过其广泛的知识库和推理能力，为基于TRIZ的创新解决方案生成提供了新机遇。本研究深入探讨了LLMs在TRIZ问题解决过程中的应用，并通过构建TRIZ案例集，为实验提供了坚实基础，同时丰富了TRIZ社区资源。我们设计了一套流程，通过逐步推理和验证策略，将具体问题转化为TRIZ问题，进而生成创新解决方案。案例研究显示，GPT-4在机械工程领域展现了其实际应用价值，生成的解决方案与原始方案高度契合，并提出了更多实施途径。

> TRIZ, the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving, is derived from a comprehensive analysis of patents across various domains, offering a framework and practical tools for problem-solving. Despite its potential to foster innovative solutions, the complexity and abstractness of TRIZ methodology often make its acquisition and application challenging. This often requires users to have a deep understanding of the theory, as well as substantial practical experience and knowledge across various disciplines. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to address these challenges by leveraging their extensive knowledge bases and reasoning capabilities for innovative solution generation within TRIZ-based problem-solving process. This study explores and evaluates the application of LLMs within the TRIZ-based problem-solving process. The construction of TRIZ case collections establishes a solid empirical foundation for our experiments and offers valuable resources to the TRIZ community. A specifically designed workflow, utilizing step-by-step reasoning and evaluation-validated prompt strategies, effectively transforms concrete problems into TRIZ problems and finally generates inventive solutions. Finally, we present a case study in mechanical engineering field that highlights the practical application of this LLM-augmented method. It showcases GPT-4's ability to generate solutions that closely resonate with original solutions and suggests more implementation mechanisms.
