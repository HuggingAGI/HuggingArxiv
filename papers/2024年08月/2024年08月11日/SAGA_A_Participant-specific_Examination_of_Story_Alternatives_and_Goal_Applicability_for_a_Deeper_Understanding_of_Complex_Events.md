> SAGA: A Participant-specific Examination of Story Alternatives and Goal Applicability for a Deeper Understanding of Complex Events

# 摘要

> 理解和推理复杂事件的关键在于解释和评估目标驱动的行动。虽然获取这种知识颇具挑战，但至关重要。我们主张，通过参与者成就的视角，可以揭示这种知识。我们分析叙事中的复杂事件，依据参与者的预期成就、未来行动及目标成功的可能性。收集了6.3K个高质量标注，平均加权Fleiss-Kappa IAA达80%，涵盖了叙事的注释替代版本，这些版本与原故事差异微小，却能引发截然不同的推断。研究发现，尽管大型语言模型能反映部分基于目标的知识，但在捕捉协同行动的设计和意图上仍显不足，即便预训练数据包含相关知识。实验表明，微调后的较小模型性能超越了大型模型。

> Interpreting and assessing goal driven actions is vital to understanding and reasoning over complex events. It is important to be able to acquire the knowledge needed for this understanding, though doing so is challenging. We argue that such knowledge can be elicited through a participant achievement lens. We analyze a complex event in a narrative according to the intended achievements of the participants in that narrative, the likely future actions of the participants, and the likelihood of goal success. We collect 6.3K high quality goal and action annotations reflecting our proposed participant achievement lens, with an average weighted Fleiss-Kappa IAA of 80%. Our collection contains annotated alternate versions of each narrative. These alternate versions vary minimally from the "original" story, but can license drastically different inferences. Our findings suggest that while modern large language models can reflect some of the goal-based knowledge we study, they find it challenging to fully capture the design and intent behind concerted actions, even when the model pretraining included the data from which we extracted the goal knowledge. We show that smaller models fine-tuned on our dataset can achieve performance surpassing larger models.
