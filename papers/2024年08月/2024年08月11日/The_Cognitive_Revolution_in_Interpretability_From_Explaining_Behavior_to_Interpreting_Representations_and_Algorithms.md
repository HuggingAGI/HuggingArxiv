> The Cognitive Revolution in Interpretability: From Explaining Behavior to Interpreting Representations and Algorithms

# 摘要

> 人工神经网络常被视为“黑箱”，尽管我们了解其计算结构和参数，但其内在的知识编码和功能仍难以解读。自深度学习兴起之初，研究者便致力于揭示这些模型的内部机制。近期，机制性可解释性（MI）作为一个新兴领域，专注于探索大型语言模型等基础模型所学特征及隐含算法。本研究将MI与认知科学相结合，后者在解析人脑等智能系统时也面临类似挑战。我们借鉴认知科学的历史进展，梳理MI的不同研究目标，并指明发展方向。首先，我们认为深度学习解释正迎来类似20世纪心理学“认知革命”的转变，从行为观察转向心理表征与处理。其次，我们提出一种分类法，借鉴计算神经科学的平行概念，将MI分为语义解释和算法解释两大类，以明确其研究目标与对象。最后，我们深入分析这两类方法的异同，评估代表性工作的优劣，阐明基本假设，概述挑战，并探讨在统一框架下整合这些解释方法的可能性。

> Artificial neural networks have long been understood as "black boxes": though we know their computation graphs and learned parameters, the knowledge encoded by these weights and functions they perform are not inherently interpretable. As such, from the early days of deep learning, there have been efforts to explain these models' behavior and understand them internally; and recently, mechanistic interpretability (MI) has emerged as a distinct research area studying the features and implicit algorithms learned by foundation models such as large language models. In this work, we aim to ground MI in the context of cognitive science, which has long struggled with analogous questions in studying and explaining the behavior of "black box" intelligent systems like the human brain. We leverage several important ideas and developments in the history of cognitive science to disentangle divergent objectives in MI and indicate a clear path forward. First, we argue that current methods are ripe to facilitate a transition in deep learning interpretation echoing the "cognitive revolution" in 20th-century psychology that shifted the study of human psychology from pure behaviorism toward mental representations and processing. Second, we propose a taxonomy mirroring key parallels in computational neuroscience to describe two broad categories of MI research, semantic interpretation (what latent representations are learned and used) and algorithmic interpretation (what operations are performed over representations) to elucidate their divergent goals and objects of study. Finally, we elaborate the parallels and distinctions between various approaches in both categories, analyze the respective strengths and weaknesses of representative works, clarify underlying assumptions, outline key challenges, and discuss the possibility of unifying these modes of interpretation under a common framework.
