> SkyScript-100M: 1,000,000,000 Pairs of Scripts and Shooting Scripts for Short Drama

# 摘要

> 高质量的拍摄脚本，包含场景和镜头语言等关键信息，是短剧剧本生成的核心。我们精心收集了6,660个热门短剧剧集，总计约80,000个短剧集，时长达2,000小时，数据量高达10TB。通过关键帧提取与标注，我们生成了约10,000,000个拍摄脚本。利用自研模型SkyReels，我们对这些脚本进行了100次还原，最终打造出包含1,000,000,000对剧本与拍摄脚本的短剧数据集SkyScript-100M。与现有数据集相比，SkyScript-100M不仅在规模上领先，更在深度见解上有所突破。基于此，研究人员可实现更为深远和精细的剧本优化，有望引领文本到视频领域的革新，并大力推动短剧视频生成技术的前进。数据与代码已公开，详见https://github.com/vaew/SkyScript-100M。

> Generating high-quality shooting scripts containing information such as scene and shot language is essential for short drama script generation. We collect 6,660 popular short drama episodes from the Internet, each with an average of 100 short episodes, and the total number of short episodes is about 80,000, with a total duration of about 2,000 hours and totaling 10 terabytes (TB). We perform keyframe extraction and annotation on each episode to obtain about 10,000,000 shooting scripts. We perform 100 script restorations on the extracted shooting scripts based on our self-developed large short drama generation model SkyReels. This leads to a dataset containing 1,000,000,000 pairs of scripts and shooting scripts for short dramas, called SkyScript-100M. We compare SkyScript-100M with the existing dataset in detail and demonstrate some deeper insights that can be achieved based on SkyScript-100M. Based on SkyScript-100M, researchers can achieve several deeper and more far-reaching script optimization goals, which may drive a paradigm shift in the entire field of text-to-video and significantly advance the field of short drama video generation.
