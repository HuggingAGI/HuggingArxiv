> "Is This It?": Towards Ecologically Valid Benchmarks for Situated Collaboration

# 摘要

> 我们初步探索了构建生态有效基准的方法，旨在评估大型多模态模型在情境协作中的表现。与现有依赖模板、人工注释或 LLM 生成问答对的基准不同，我们提出了一种由交互系统驱动的新方法，用户在与端到端情境 AI 系统互动时实时生成问题。这些问题的形式和内容与传统具身问答 (EQA) 基准中的问题大相径庭，揭示了现实世界中的新挑战。

> We report initial work towards constructing ecologically valid benchmarks to assess the capabilities of large multimodal models for engaging in situated collaboration. In contrast to existing benchmarks, in which question-answer pairs are generated post hoc over preexisting or synthetic datasets via templates, human annotators, or large language models (LLMs), we propose and investigate an interactive system-driven approach, where the questions are generated by users in context, during their interactions with an end-to-end situated AI system. We illustrate how the questions that arise are different in form and content from questions typically found in existing embodied question answering (EQA) benchmarks and discuss new real-world challenge problems brought to the fore.
