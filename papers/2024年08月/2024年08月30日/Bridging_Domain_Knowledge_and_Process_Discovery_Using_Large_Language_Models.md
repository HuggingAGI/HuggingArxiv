# 摘要

> 在过程分析任务中，如一致性检查和改进，发现优质的过程模型至关重要。然而，传统自动化方法常忽略关键的领域知识。本文通过大型语言模型（LLMs），将这些未充分利用的知识融入过程发现，确保模型与实际操作和专家见解相符。这一创新不仅在自然语言与模型构建间搭建了桥梁，还大幅提升了过程发现的有效性。我们与UWV员工保险机构的案例研究，进一步证实了这一框架的实用价值和成效。

> Discovering good process models is essential for different process analysis tasks such as conformance checking and process improvements. Automated process discovery methods often overlook valuable domain knowledge. This knowledge, including insights from domain experts and detailed process documentation, remains largely untapped during process discovery. This paper leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate such knowledge directly into process discovery. We use rules derived from LLMs to guide model construction, ensuring alignment with both domain knowledge and actual process executions. By integrating LLMs, we create a bridge between process knowledge expressed in natural language and the discovery of robust process models, advancing process discovery methodologies significantly. To showcase the usability of our framework, we conducted a case study with the UWV employee insurance agency, demonstrating its practical benefits and effectiveness.
