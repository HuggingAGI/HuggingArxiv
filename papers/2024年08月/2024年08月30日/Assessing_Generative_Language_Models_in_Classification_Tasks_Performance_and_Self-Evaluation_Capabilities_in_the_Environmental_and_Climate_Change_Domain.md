> Assessing Generative Language Models in Classification Tasks: Performance and Self-Evaluation Capabilities in the Environmental and Climate Change Domain

# 摘要

> 本文探讨了GPT3.5、Llama2和Gemma在气候变化与环境领域的分类任务中的表现，以BERT模型为基准进行对比。研究发现，尽管BERT模型总体表现更佳，但大型生成模型的表现亦不容忽视。校准分析显示，Gemma初期校准良好，后续结果不一致；Llama校准合理，GPT则始终表现出色。本研究旨在深化对生成语言模型在生态与气候变化问题中应用的理解，揭示其优势与局限。

> This paper examines the performance of two Large Language Models (LLMs), GPT3.5 and Llama2 and one Small Language Model (SLM) Gemma, across three different classification tasks within the climate change (CC) and environmental domain. Employing BERT-based models as a baseline, we compare their efficacy against these transformer-based models. Additionally, we assess the models' self-evaluation capabilities by analyzing the calibration of verbalized confidence scores in these text classification tasks. Our findings reveal that while BERT-based models generally outperform both the LLMs and SLM, the performance of the large generative models is still noteworthy. Furthermore, our calibration analysis reveals that although Gemma is well-calibrated in initial tasks, it thereafter produces inconsistent results; Llama is reasonably calibrated, and GPT consistently exhibits strong calibration. Through this research, we aim to contribute to the ongoing discussion on the utility and effectiveness of generative LMs in addressing some of the planet's most urgent issues, highlighting their strengths and limitations in the context of ecology and CC.
