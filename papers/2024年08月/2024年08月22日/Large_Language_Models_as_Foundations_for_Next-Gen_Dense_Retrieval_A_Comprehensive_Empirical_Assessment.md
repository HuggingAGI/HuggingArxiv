> Large Language Models as Foundations for Next-Gen Dense Retrieval: A Comprehensive Empirical Assessment

# 摘要

> BERT和T5等预训练语言模型在密集检索中扮演着关键角色，但它们的泛化能力和领域准确性提升有限。近期研究采用大型语言模型（LLM）作为检索器，取得了显著成果。尽管如此，LLM相较于传统检索器的优势及其配置（如参数规模、预训练时长和对齐策略）对检索性能的影响尚不明确。本研究针对多种检索任务进行了深入分析，包括领域精度、数据效率、零样本泛化等，并评估了15种以上模型。研究显示，更大规模的模型和更长时间的预训练能持续提升领域精度和数据效率，同时在零样本泛化等方面展现出巨大潜力。这些发现突显了LLM在密集检索中的多面性和高效性，为该领域的未来发展提供了重要启示。

> Pretrained language models like BERT and T5 serve as crucial backbone encoders for dense retrieval. However, these models often exhibit limited generalization capabilities and face challenges in improving in domain accuracy. Recent research has explored using large language models (LLMs) as retrievers, achieving SOTA performance across various tasks. Despite these advancements, the specific benefits of LLMs over traditional retrievers and the impact of different LLM configurations, such as parameter sizes, pretraining duration, and alignment processes on retrieval tasks remain unclear. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on a wide range of retrieval tasks, including in domain accuracy, data efficiency, zero shot generalization, lengthy retrieval, instruction based retrieval, and multi task learning. We evaluate over 15 different backbone LLMs and non LLMs. Our findings reveal that larger models and extensive pretraining consistently enhance in domain accuracy and data efficiency. Additionally, larger models demonstrate significant potential in zero shot generalization, lengthy retrieval, instruction based retrieval, and multi task learning. These results underscore the advantages of LLMs as versatile and effective backbone encoders in dense retrieval, providing valuable insights for future research and development in this field.
