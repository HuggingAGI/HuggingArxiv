> MuMA-ToM: Multi-modal Multi-Agent Theory of Mind

# 摘要

> 在复杂现实场景中理解人们的社交互动，需要深入的心理推理。为了洞察人们互动的深层原因和方式，我们必须揭示驱动这些互动的内在心理状态，即多主体互动中的心智理论推理。社交互动的多模态特性——观察、聆听和阅读——要求AI系统不仅理解个体心理状态，还要基于多模态信息推断彼此的心理状态。为此，我们推出了MuMA-ToM，首个评估具身多主体互动中心理推理的多模态心智理论基准。通过提供真实家庭环境中的多模态行为描述，MuMA-ToM引导我们探索人们的目标、信念及对他人目标的认知。在人类实验中验证MuMA-ToM并设定人类基线后，我们创新性地提出了LIMP模型，该模型在性能上显著超越了包括GPT-4o和BIP-ALM在内的顶尖模型。

> Understanding people's social interactions in complex real-world scenarios often relies on intricate mental reasoning. To truly understand how and why people interact with one another, we must infer the underlying mental states that give rise to the social interactions, i.e., Theory of Mind reasoning in multi-agent interactions. Additionally, social interactions are often multi-modal -- we can watch people's actions, hear their conversations, and/or read about their past behaviors. For AI systems to successfully and safely interact with people in real-world environments, they also need to understand people's mental states as well as their inferences about each other's mental states based on multi-modal information about their interactions. For this, we introduce MuMA-ToM, a Multi-modal Multi-Agent Theory of Mind benchmark. MuMA-ToM is the first multi-modal Theory of Mind benchmark that evaluates mental reasoning in embodied multi-agent interactions. In MuMA-ToM, we provide video and text descriptions of people's multi-modal behavior in realistic household environments. Based on the context, we then ask questions about people's goals, beliefs, and beliefs about others' goals. We validated MuMA-ToM in a human experiment and provided a human baseline. We also proposed a novel multi-modal, multi-agent ToM model, LIMP (Language model-based Inverse Multi-agent Planning). Our experimental results show that LIMP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including large multi-modal models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5 Pro) and a recent multi-modal ToM model, BIP-ALM.
