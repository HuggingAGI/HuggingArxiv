# 摘要

> 大型语言模型与多模态基础模型的崛起，激发了人们对视觉与语言融合应用的浓厚兴趣。本文深入探讨了 ChatGPT-4V 和 Gemini Pro 在街景、建筑及室内领域的应用能力，通过一系列任务评估其表现，如街景中的家具识别、人流车流统计、道路宽度测量，建筑领域的功能分类、年代分析、高度评估及结构识别，以及室内环境的房间分类、设计风格解析、家具数量统计和空间尺寸测量。研究显示，这些模型在尺寸测量、风格解析、问答及基础图像理解方面表现优异，但在精细识别与计数任务上仍有不足。尽管零-shot 学习潜力巨大，但性能受问题领域与图像复杂度影响。本研究揭示了多模态模型在实际应用中的优势与局限，强调了其在计算机视觉与语言学交叉领域推动跨学科发展的潜力。

> The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal foundation models (FMs) has generated heightened interest in their applications that integrate vision and language. This paper investigates the capabilities of ChatGPT-4V and Gemini Pro for Street View Imagery, Built Environment, and Interior by evaluating their performance across various tasks. The assessments include street furniture identification, pedestrian and car counts, and road width measurement in Street View Imagery; building function classification, building age analysis, building height analysis, and building structure classification in the Built Environment; and interior room classification, interior design style analysis, interior furniture counts, and interior length measurement in Interior. The results reveal proficiency in length measurement, style analysis, question answering, and basic image understanding, but highlight limitations in detailed recognition and counting tasks. While zero-shot learning shows potential, performance varies depending on the problem domains and image complexities. This study provides new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of multimodal foundation models for practical challenges in Street View Imagery, Built Environment, and Interior. Overall, the findings demonstrate foundational multimodal intelligence, emphasizing the potential of FMs to drive forward interdisciplinary applications at the intersection of computer vision and language.
