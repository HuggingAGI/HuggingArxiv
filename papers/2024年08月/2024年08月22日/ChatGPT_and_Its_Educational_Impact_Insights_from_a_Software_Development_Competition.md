# 摘要

> 本研究深入探讨了 ChatGPT 在教育环境中的整合及其影响。我们组织了一场为期四周的软件开发竞赛，36 名学生参与其中，利用 ChatGPT 提升项目表现。竞赛分为两轮，第一轮所有学生参与，根据代码质量、创新性和项目要求遵守情况进行评估，前 15 名进入第二轮，争夺最终排名。结果显示，广泛使用 ChatGPT 的学生在项目完成率和得分上表现更佳。详细分析发现，获胜者在生成式 AI 经验、语言模型学习和学科兴趣上存在显著差异。这些发现表明 ChatGPT 显著提升了个人学习和项目表现。参与者的事后调查也显示了高满意度，进一步证明了 ChatGPT 在学术环境中的积极影响。本研究强调了 ChatGPT 在项目学习中的变革潜力，并呼吁进一步研究其长期影响和广泛应用。

> This study explores the integration and impact of ChatGPT, a generative AI that utilizes natural language processing, in an educational environment. The main goal is to evaluate how ChatGPT affects project performance. To this end, we organize a software development competition utilizing ChatGPT, lasting for four weeks and involving 36 students. The competition is structured in two rounds: in the first round, all 36 students participate and are evaluated based on specific performance metrics such as code quality, innovation, and adherence to project requirements. The top 15 performers from the first round are then selected to advance to the second round, where they compete for the final rankings and the overall winner is determined. The competition shows that students who use ChatGPT extensively in various stages of development, including ideation, documentation, software development, and quality assurance, have higher project completion rates and better scores. A detailed comparative analysis between first-round and second-round winners reveals significant differences in their experience with generative AI for software development, experience learning large-scale language models, and interest in their respective fields of study. These findings suggest that ChatGPT enhances individual learning and project performance. A post-survey of participants also reveals high levels of satisfaction, further emphasizing the benefits of integrating generative AI like ChatGPT in academic settings. This study highlights the transformative potential of ChatGPT in project-based learning environments and supports further research into its long-term impact and broader application in a variety of educational contexts.
