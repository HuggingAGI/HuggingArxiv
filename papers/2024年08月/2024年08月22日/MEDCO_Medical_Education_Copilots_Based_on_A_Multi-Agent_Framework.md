# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLM）在医学和医疗保健等多个研究领域的影响深远，但其作为医学教育助手的潜力尚待挖掘。现有的AI辅助教育工具因单一学习模式和无法模拟实际医学培训的多学科互动特性而受限。为此，我们推出了MEDCO（医学教育副驾驶），一个基于多代理的创新系统，旨在模拟真实的医学培训环境。MEDCO系统包括自主患者、专家医生和放射科医生三个核心代理，共同营造一个多模式、互动的学习环境。我们的框架着重于培养学生的提问技巧、跨学科协作和同伴交流。实验表明，接受MEDCO训练的虚拟学生不仅在性能上大幅提升，媲美先进模型，还展现出类似人类的学习行为和进步，学习样本数量也有所增加。这项研究通过引入互动协作的学习助手，为医学教育领域带来了新思路，并深入探讨了AI集成培训模式的有效性。

> Large language models (LLMs) have had a significant impact on diverse research domains, including medicine and healthcare. However, the potential of LLMs as copilots in medical education remains underexplored. Current AI-assisted educational tools are limited by their solitary learning approach and inability to simulate the multi-disciplinary and interactive nature of actual medical training. To address these limitations, we propose MEDCO (Medical EDucation COpilots), a novel multi-agent-based copilot system specially developed to emulate real-world medical training environments. MEDCO incorporates three primary agents: an agentic patient, an expert doctor, and a radiologist, facilitating a multi-modal and interactive learning environment. Our framework emphasizes the learning of proficient question-asking skills, multi-disciplinary collaboration, and peer discussions between students. Our experiments show that simulated virtual students who underwent training with MEDCO not only achieved substantial performance enhancements comparable to those of advanced models, but also demonstrated human-like learning behaviors and improvements, coupled with an increase in the number of learning samples. This work contributes to medical education by introducing a copilot that implements an interactive and collaborative learning approach. It also provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of AI-integrated training paradigms.
