# 摘要

> 当前RAGs研究跨足多学科，因其技术飞速进步，研究焦点多在技术创新而非商业应用。为此，我们致力于构建一个分类体系，全面梳理RAG应用的本质特征，助力其在信息系统领域的推广。目前，尚无RAG应用的分类体系问世。我们详述了分类体系的构建方法，涵盖论文筛选标准、借助大型语言模型（LLM）提取特征的合理性，以及分类体系概念化的系统流程。分类体系构建历经四轮迭代，旨在深化对RAG核心维度的认识与表达。我们共设定了五个元维度与十六个维度，力求全面把握检索增强生成（RAG）应用的精髓。在成果探讨中，我们亦指明了具体研究方向，并提出关键问题，引领未来信息系统研究者深入探索RAG系统的新兴议题。

> Current research on RAGs is distributed across various disciplines, and since the technology is evolving very quickly, its unit of analysis is mostly on technological innovations, rather than applications in business contexts. Thus, in this research, we aim to create a taxonomy to conceptualize a comprehensive overview of the constituting characteristics that define RAG applications, facilitating the adoption of this technology in the IS community. To the best of our knowledge, no RAG application taxonomies have been developed so far. We describe our methodology for developing the taxonomy, which includes the criteria for selecting papers, an explanation of our rationale for employing a Large Language Model (LLM)-supported approach to extract and identify initial characteristics, and a concise overview of our systematic process for conceptualizing the taxonomy. Our systematic taxonomy development process includes four iterative phases designed to refine and enhance our understanding and presentation of RAG's core dimensions. We have developed a total of five meta-dimensions and sixteen dimensions to comprehensively capture the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. When discussing our findings, we also detail the specific research areas and pose key research questions to guide future information system researchers as they explore the emerging topics of RAG systems.
