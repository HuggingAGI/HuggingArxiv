> A Quantum-Inspired Analysis of Human Disambiguation Processes

# 摘要

> 形式语言是计算机编程的基础，设计得便于计算机处理。而自然语言的复杂性则推动了NLP领域的发展，其中歧义是一个主要难题。NLP的进步催生了能够高精度解决歧义的大型语言模型。与此同时，量子计算机的崛起因其解决某些问题的高效性而备受瞩目，这一新范式已涉足机器学习和NLP领域，带来了混合经典-量子学习算法。然而，要确定哪些NLP任务能真正受益于量子优势，仍需深入研究。在本论文中，我们运用了量子力学的基本概念，如上下文性和因果性，来探索语言歧义。这一方法不仅重现了人类消歧的心理语言学结果，还成功预测了人类行为，超越了现有的NLP技术。

> Formal languages are essential for computer programming and are constructed to be easily processed by computers. In contrast, natural languages are much more challenging and instigated the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). One major obstacle is the ubiquity of ambiguities. Recent advances in NLP have led to the development of large language models, which can resolve ambiguities with high accuracy. At the same time, quantum computers have gained much attention in recent years as they can solve some computational problems faster than classical computers. This new computing paradigm has reached the fields of machine learning and NLP, where hybrid classical-quantum learning algorithms have emerged. However, more research is needed to identify which NLP tasks could benefit from a genuine quantum advantage. In this thesis, we applied formalisms arising from foundational quantum mechanics, such as contextuality and causality, to study ambiguities arising from linguistics. By doing so, we also reproduced psycholinguistic results relating to the human disambiguation process. These results were subsequently used to predict human behaviour and outperformed current NLP methods.
