> From Brazilian Portuguese to European Portuguese

# 摘要

> 巴西葡萄牙语和欧洲葡萄牙语虽为同源，却各具特色。资源分布不均，巴西葡萄牙语资源更为丰富，这可能影响欧洲葡萄牙语用户的翻译服务质量。为此，我们计划开发一款翻译系统，将巴西葡萄牙语转换为欧洲葡萄牙语，借助神经网络技术的最新成果。为确保系统性能，我们精心编制了一个包含500句、涵盖五类主题的金标准测试集，每句提供双份参考，便于未来模型评估。我们利用电影字幕和TED演讲的双语文本，对大型语言模型进行微调，并进行了自动与人工双重评估。所有模型均与当前顶尖的ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo进行了对比测试。

> Brazilian Portuguese and European Portuguese are two varieties of the same language and, despite their close similarities, they exhibit several differences. However, there is a significant disproportion in the availability of resources between the two variants, with Brazilian Portuguese having more abundant resources. This inequity can impact the quality of translation services accessible to European Portuguese speakers. To address this issue, we propose the development of a Brazilian Portuguese to European Portuguese translation system, leveraging recent advancements in neural architectures and models. To evaluate the performance of such systems, we manually curated a gold test set comprising 500 sentences across five different topics. Each sentence in the gold test set has two distinct references, facilitating a straightforward evaluation of future translation models. We experimented with various models by fine-tuning existing Large Language Models using parallel data extracted from movie subtitles and TED Talks transcripts in both Brazilian and European Portuguese. Our evaluation involved the use of conventional automatic metrics as well as a human evaluation. In addition, all models were compared against ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo, which currently yields the best results.
