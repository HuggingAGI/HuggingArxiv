> New Curriculum, New Chance -- Retrieval Augmented Generation for Lesson Planning in Ugandan Secondary Schools. Prototype Quality Evaluation

# 摘要

> 引言：在乌干达，尤其是农村地区，中学教育质量问题依然严峻。随着新课程的推行，教案过时问题加剧。我们利用检索增强生成技术，开发了一个原型，根据官方教科书定制教案，助力教师高效、高质量地备课，确保与新课程和能力本位学习方法同步。方法：该原型结合Cohere LLM、句子嵌入和LangChain框架开发，并在网上公开。针对三本新课程教科书（ICT、数学、历史），进行了向量存储训练。根据教科书课时建议，生成了24份教案，并由三位独立评分者依据专门针对东非和能力本位课程的教案分析协议（LPAP）进行质量评估。结果：评估显示，24份教案平均质量达75%至80%，属于“非常好的教案”。所有教案得分均不低于65%，尽管有一份可能缺失主题。总体而言，生成的教案质量至少与人工教案相当，甚至更优，如卢旺达研究显示，人工教案甚至未达50%基准。

> Introduction: Poor educational quality in Secondary Schools is still regarded as one of the major struggles in 21st century Uganda - especially in rural areas. Research identifies several problems, including low quality or absent teacher lesson planning. As the government pushes towards the implementation of a new curriculum, exiting lesson plans become obsolete and the problem is worsened. Using a Retrieval Augmented Generation approach, we developed a prototype that generates customized lesson plans based on the government-accredited textbooks. This helps teachers create lesson plans more efficiently and with better quality, ensuring they are fully aligned the new curriculum and the competence-based learning approach.
  Methods: The prototype was created using Cohere LLM and Sentence Embeddings, and LangChain Framework - and thereafter made available on a public website. Vector stores were trained for three new curriculum textbooks (ICT, Mathematics, History), all at Secondary 1 Level. Twenty-four lessons plans were generated following a pseudo-random generation protocol, based on the suggested periods in the textbooks. The lesson plans were analyzed regarding their technical quality by three independent raters following the Lesson Plan Analysis Protocol (LPAP) by Ndihokubwayo et al. (2022) that is specifically designed for East Africa and competence-based curriculums.
  Results: Evaluation of 24 lesson plans using the LPAP resulted in an average quality of between 75 and 80%, corresponding to "very good lesson plan". None of the lesson plans scored below 65%, although one lesson plan could be argued to have been missing the topic. In conclusion, the quality of the generated lesson plans is at least comparable, if not better, than those created by humans, as demonstrated in a study in Rwanda, whereby no lesson plan even reached the benchmark of 50%.
