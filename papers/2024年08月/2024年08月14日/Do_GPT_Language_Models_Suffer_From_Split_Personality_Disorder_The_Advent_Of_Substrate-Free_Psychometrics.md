> Do GPT Language Models Suffer From Split Personality Disorder? The Advent Of Substrate-Free Psychometrics

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型在模拟人类能力和心理特质方面虽有显著表现，但其潜在特质的表达和程度存在矛盾，尤其在自恋、精神病态和马基雅维利主义等黑暗三联征上得分高，引发了对模型安全性的担忧。我们通过九种语言的人格问卷对先进语言模型进行测试，并运用贝叶斯分析，揭示了模型人格不稳定的深层问题。这种不稳定性可能导致依赖这些模型的AI系统行为不安全，随着这些系统深入人类生活，这一问题更显紧迫。我们进一步探讨了现代心理测量的局限，并提出一个超越物种和基质的全新框架，以期解决这些问题。

> Previous research on emergence in large language models shows these display apparent human-like abilities and psychological latent traits. However, results are partly contradicting in expression and magnitude of these latent traits, yet agree on the worrisome tendencies to score high on the Dark Triad of narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism, which, together with a track record of derailments, demands more rigorous research on safety of these models. We provided a state of the art language model with the same personality questionnaire in nine languages, and performed Bayesian analysis of Gaussian Mixture Model, finding evidence for a deeper-rooted issue. Our results suggest both interlingual and intralingual instabilities, which indicate that current language models do not develop a consistent core personality. This can lead to unsafe behaviour of artificial intelligence systems that are based on these foundation models, and are increasingly integrated in human life. We subsequently discuss the shortcomings of modern psychometrics, abstract it, and provide a framework for its species-neutral, substrate-free formulation.
