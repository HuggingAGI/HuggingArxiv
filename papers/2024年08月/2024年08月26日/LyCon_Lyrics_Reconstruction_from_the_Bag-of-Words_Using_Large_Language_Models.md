> LyCon: Lyrics Reconstruction from the Bag-of-Words Using Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 本文针对歌词研究中的版权限制问题，提出了一种创新方法。通过利用公开的 Bag-of-Words 数据集及其元数据，结合大型语言模型，我们成功重建了无版权歌词，并创建了 LyCon 数据集。该数据集与多个知名数据库的元数据同步，现已公开。我们相信，通过整合情绪和流派等元数据，LyCon 将促进歌词生成等学术研究的发展。

> This paper addresses the unique challenge of conducting research in lyric studies, where direct use of lyrics is often restricted due to copyright concerns. Unlike typical data, internet-sourced lyrics are frequently protected under copyright law, necessitating alternative approaches. Our study introduces a novel method for generating copyright-free lyrics from publicly available Bag-of-Words (BoW) datasets, which contain the vocabulary of lyrics but not the lyrics themselves. Utilizing metadata associated with BoW datasets and large language models, we successfully reconstructed lyrics. We have compiled and made available a dataset of reconstructed lyrics, LyCon, aligned with metadata from renowned sources including the Million Song Dataset, Deezer Mood Detection Dataset, and AllMusic Genre Dataset, available for public access. We believe that the integration of metadata such as mood annotations or genres enables a variety of academic experiments on lyrics, such as conditional lyric generation.
