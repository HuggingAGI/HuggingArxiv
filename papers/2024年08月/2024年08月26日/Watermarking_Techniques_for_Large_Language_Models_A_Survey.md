> Watermarking Techniques for Large Language Models: A Survey

# 摘要

> 随着AI技术的飞速进步，大型语言模型（LLMs）在提升生产、创意、学习和工作效率方面发挥着巨大作用。但LLMs的滥用也带来了知识产权、学术诚信、虚假信息等社会问题。为此，研究者提出LLM水印技术，旨在保护知识产权并追踪多媒体数据。本篇综述首次全面探讨了LLM水印技术，从传统水印历史出发，分析了当前研究现状及其技术继承与关联。通过这些分析，我们为将传统水印技术应用于LLM提供了新思路，推动了水印技术的创新与融合。同时，针对LLMs的多模态发展，本综述详细分析了视觉、音频等多模态水印技术，为未来研究提供了丰富参考。最后，我们深入探讨了水印技术的挑战与前景，为LLM水印的未来研究与应用指明了方向。

> With the rapid advancement and extensive application of artificial intelligence technology, large language models (LLMs) are extensively used to enhance production, creativity, learning, and work efficiency across various domains. However, the abuse of LLMs also poses potential harm to human society, such as intellectual property rights issues, academic misconduct, false content, and hallucinations. Relevant research has proposed the use of LLM watermarking to achieve IP protection for LLMs and traceability of multimedia data output by LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first thorough review that investigates and analyzes LLM watermarking technology in detail. This review begins by recounting the history of traditional watermarking technology, then analyzes the current state of LLM watermarking research, and thoroughly examines the inheritance and relevance of these techniques. By analyzing their inheritance and relevance, this review can provide research with ideas for applying traditional digital watermarking techniques to LLM watermarking, to promote the cross-integration and innovation of watermarking technology. In addition, this review examines the pros and cons of LLM watermarking. Considering the current multimodal development trend of LLMs, it provides a detailed analysis of emerging multimodal LLM watermarking, such as visual and audio data, to offer more reference ideas for relevant research. This review delves into the challenges and future prospects of current watermarking technologies, offering valuable insights for future LLM watermarking research and applications.
