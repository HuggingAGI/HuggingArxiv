> Claim Verification in the Age of Large Language Models: A Survey

# 摘要

> 随着互联网数据的激增和手动验证的繁琐，自动声明验证系统应运而生。近年来，深度学习和变换器模型在此领域大放异彩。特别是大型语言模型（LLM）的引入，不仅提升了多个NLP任务的性能，还催生了基于LLM的声明验证新方法，如检索增强生成（RAG）。本调查深入探讨了这些LLM驱动的声明验证框架，详述其核心组件，包括检索、提示和微调策略。此外，我们还介绍了为此任务精心构建的公开英语数据集。

> The large and ever-increasing amount of data available on the Internet coupled with the laborious task of manual claim and fact verification has sparked the interest in the development of automated claim verification systems. Several deep learning and transformer-based models have been proposed for this task over the years. With the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their superior performance in several NLP tasks, we have seen a surge of LLM-based approaches to claim verification along with the use of novel methods such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). In this survey, we present a comprehensive account of recent claim verification frameworks using LLMs. We describe the different components of the claim verification pipeline used in these frameworks in detail including common approaches to retrieval, prompting, and fine-tuning. Finally, we describe publicly available English datasets created for this task.
