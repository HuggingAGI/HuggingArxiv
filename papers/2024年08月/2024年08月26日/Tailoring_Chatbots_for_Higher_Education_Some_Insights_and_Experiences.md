> Tailoring Chatbots for Higher Education: Some Insights and Experiences

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型的普及对高等教育影响深远，但通用模型未必总能满足专业任务的需求。使用这些模型时，特定领域知识的需求迅速显现，定制化机器人的需求也随之而生。定制化有望提升响应的准确性和相关性，从而优化教育体验。本报告旨在探讨“定制化”大型语言模型在高等教育中的实际意义，并分享瑞士苏黎世联邦理工学院（ETH Zurich）的相关见解与经验。

> The general availability of powerful Large Language Models had a powerful impact on higher education, yet general models may not always be useful for the associated specialized tasks. When using these models, oftentimes the need for particular domain knowledge becomes quickly apparent, and the desire for customized bots arises. Customization holds the promise of leading to more accurate and contextually relevant responses, enhancing the educational experience. The purpose of this short technical experience report is to describe what "customizing" Large Language Models means in practical terms for higher education institutions. This report thus relates insights and experiences from one particular technical university in Switzerland, ETH Zurich.
