> Foundation Models for Music: A Survey

# 摘要

> 近年来，大型语言模型和潜在扩散模型等基础模型在音乐等多个领域产生了深远影响。本综述全面探讨了音乐领域的SOTA预训练模型和基础模型，从表示学习到多模态学习均有涉及。我们首先强调了音乐在各行业中的重要性，并追溯了AI在音乐领域的演变历程。通过分析基础模型所针对的模态，我们发现许多音乐表示在FM开发中尚未得到充分探索。随后，我们指出了先前方法在多样音乐应用中的不足，并探讨了FMs在音乐理解、生成和医疗应用中的潜力。通过深入探讨模型预训练范式、架构选择、标记化、微调方法和可控性等细节，我们强调了应深入研究的重要主题，如指令调优和情境学习、规模法则和涌现能力，以及长序列建模等。此外，我们还提供了对音乐代理的见解，并深入分析了预训练和下游任务所需的数据集和评估。最后，我们强调了伦理考虑的重要性，并主张未来关于音乐FM的研究应更多关注解释性、透明度、人类责任和版权问题。本文旨在为音乐领域中FMs的未来挑战和趋势提供见解，以促进音乐领域中人机协作的发展。

> In recent years, foundation models (FMs) such as large language models (LLMs) and latent diffusion models (LDMs) have profoundly impacted diverse sectors, including music. This comprehensive review examines state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained models and foundation models in music, spanning from representation learning, generative learning and multimodal learning. We first contextualise the significance of music in various industries and trace the evolution of AI in music. By delineating the modalities targeted by foundation models, we discover many of the music representations are underexplored in FM development. Then, emphasis is placed on the lack of versatility of previous methods on diverse music applications, along with the potential of FMs in music understanding, generation and medical application. By comprehensively exploring the details of the model pre-training paradigm, architectural choices, tokenisation, finetuning methodologies and controllability, we emphasise the important topics that should have been well explored, like instruction tuning and in-context learning, scaling law and emergent ability, as well as long-sequence modelling etc. A dedicated section presents insights into music agents, accompanied by a thorough analysis of datasets and evaluations essential for pre-training and downstream tasks. Finally, by underscoring the vital importance of ethical considerations, we advocate that following research on FM for music should focus more on such issues as interpretability, transparency, human responsibility, and copyright issues. The paper offers insights into future challenges and trends on FMs for music, aiming to shape the trajectory of human-AI collaboration in the music realm.
