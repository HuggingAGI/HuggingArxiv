> SWE-bench-java: A GitHub Issue Resolving Benchmark for Java

# 摘要

> GitHub issue resolving 在软件工程中至关重要，近期在业界和学术界备受瞩目。SWE-bench 用于评估 LLM 的 issue resolving 能力，但目前仅限于 Python。考虑到业界的强烈需求，我们推出了 Java 版本的 SWE-bench-java，并公开了数据集、Docker 评估环境和排行榜，将持续更新。为确保其可靠性，我们采用了 SWE-agent 方法并测试了多个 LLM。开发多语言基准耗时且费力，我们欢迎各界通过 pull request 或合作，共同推动其迭代与完善，助力编程自动化。

> GitHub issue resolving is a critical task in software engineering, recently gaining significant attention in both industry and academia. Within this task, SWE-bench has been released to evaluate issue resolving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but has so far only focused on Python version. However, supporting more programming languages is also important, as there is a strong demand in industry. As a first step toward multilingual support, we have developed a Java version of SWE-bench, called SWE-bench-java. We have publicly released the dataset, along with the corresponding Docker-based evaluation environment and leaderboard, which will be continuously maintained and updated in the coming months. To verify the reliability of SWE-bench-java, we implement a classic method SWE-agent and test several powerful LLMs on it. As is well known, developing a high-quality multi-lingual benchmark is time-consuming and labor-intensive, so we welcome contributions through pull requests or collaboration to accelerate its iteration and refinement, paving the way for fully automated programming.
