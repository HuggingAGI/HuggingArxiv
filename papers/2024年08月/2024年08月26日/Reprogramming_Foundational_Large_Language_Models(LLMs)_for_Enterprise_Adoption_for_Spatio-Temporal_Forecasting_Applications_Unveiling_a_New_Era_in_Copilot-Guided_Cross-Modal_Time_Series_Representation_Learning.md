> Reprogramming Foundational Large Language Models(LLMs) for Enterprise Adoption for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting Applications: Unveiling a New Era in Copilot-Guided Cross-Modal Time Series Representation Learning

# 摘要

> 时空预测在多个行业中至关重要，但现有方法难以应对大型复杂数据集。为此，我们提出了一种混合策略，融合了开源大型和小型语言模型与传统预测技术。通过动态提示和分组查询、多头注意力机制，我们增强了传统方法，更有效地捕捉了时间序列数据中的依赖关系。我们还通过LoRA-AMR技术在消费级硬件上微调开源LMs，实现了本地定制，同时减少了计算和内存需求。结合语言模型和传统时间序列分析，我们的方法在真实数据集上进行了广泛测试，预测准确性显著超越现有技术。

> Spatio-temporal forecasting plays a crucial role in various sectors such as transportation systems, logistics, and supply chain management. However, existing methods are limited by their ability to handle large, complex datasets. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of open-source large and small-scale language models (LLMs and LMs) with traditional forecasting methods. We augment traditional methods with dynamic prompting and a grouped-query, multi-head attention mechanism to more effectively capture both intra-series and inter-series dependencies in evolving nonlinear time series data. In addition, we facilitate on-premises customization by fine-tuning smaller open-source LMs for time series trend analysis utilizing descriptions generated by open-source large LMs on consumer-grade hardware using Low-Rank Adaptation with Activation Memory Reduction (LoRA-AMR) technique to reduce computational overhead and activation storage memory demands while preserving inference latency. We combine language model processing for time series trend analysis with traditional time series representation learning method for cross-modal integration, achieving robust and accurate forecasts. The framework effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments on various real-world datasets, outperforming existing methods by significant margins in terms of forecast accuracy.
