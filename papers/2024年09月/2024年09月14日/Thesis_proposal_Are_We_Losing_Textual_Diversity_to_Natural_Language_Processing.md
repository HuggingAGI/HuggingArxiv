# 摘要

> 本论文探讨了当前自然语言处理算法可能存在的局限性，特别是它们处理和生成文本的特性。随着这些工具的广泛应用，我们必须深入了解这些局限性及其对日常生活的潜在影响。我们以神经机器翻译（NMT）为研究对象，但目标是获得适用于大型语言模型（LLMs）的普遍见解。我们探讨了NMT算法是否存在对典型输入有益但对非典型文本有害的固有偏差。为此，我们基于文本的统计属性（如单词意外性的均匀性和节奏性）定义了多样性度量，并在多个尺度上进行分析。实验结果显示，NMT系统在维持文本多样性方面可能存在困难，从而影响了生成语言的丰富性。我们进一步探究了这些局限性的根源，包括训练目标和解码算法。最终，我们旨在开发不强制输出一致性且能更好规划翻译的替代方案，以应对翻译任务的内在模糊性。

> This thesis argues that the currently widely used Natural Language Processing algorithms possibly have various limitations related to the properties of the texts they handle and produce. With the wide adoption of these tools in rapid progress, we must ask what these limitations are and what are the possible implications of integrating such tools even more deeply into our daily lives.
  As a testbed, we have chosen the task of Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Nevertheless, we aim for general insights and outcomes, applicable even to current Large Language Models (LLMs). We ask whether the algorithms used in NMT have inherent inductive biases that are beneficial for most types of inputs but might harm the processing of untypical texts. To explore this hypothesis, we define a set of measures to quantify text diversity based on its statistical properties, like uniformity or rhythmicity of word-level surprisal, on multiple scales (sentence, discourse, language). We then conduct a series of experiments to investigate whether NMT systems struggle with maintaining the diversity of such texts, potentially reducing the richness of the language generated by these systems, compared to human translators.
  We search for potential causes of these limitations rooted in training objectives and decoding algorithms. Our ultimate goal is to develop alternatives that do not enforce uniformity in the distribution of statistical properties in the output and that allow for better global planning of the translation, taking into account the intrinsic ambiguity of the translation task.
