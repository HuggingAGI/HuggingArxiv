> Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models for Automated Medical Documentation

# 摘要

> 研究表明，医生每直接照顾病人一小时，就要额外花费近两小时在电子健康记录和文书工作上，这不仅减少了护理时间，还加剧了医生倦怠和医疗低效。为此，本研究推出了MediGen，一个专为自动生成医疗报告而微调的大型语言模型。通过先进技术，包括LLaMA3-8B，MediGen在转录和总结临床对话上表现出色，ROUGE分数达58%，BERTScore-F1达72%，显示出其在生成准确临床报告方面的潜力。MediGen有望大幅减轻医生行政负担，提升医疗效率和医生福祉。

> Scientific research indicates that for every hour spent in direct patient care, physicians spend nearly two additional hours on administrative tasks, particularly on electronic health records (EHRs) and desk work. This excessive administrative burden not only reduces the time available for patient care but also contributes to physician burnout and inefficiencies in healthcare delivery. To address these challenges, this study introduces MediGen, a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) designed to automate the generation of medical reports from medical dialogues. By leveraging state-of-the-art methodologies for fine-tuning open-source pretrained models, including LLaMA3-8B, MediGen achieves high accuracy in transcribing and summarizing clinical interactions. The fine-tuned LLaMA3-8B model demonstrated promising results, achieving a ROUGE score of 58% and a BERTScore-F1 of 72%, indicating its effectiveness in generating accurate and clinically relevant medical reports. These findings suggest that MediGen has the potential to significantly reduce the administrative workload on physicians, improving both healthcare efficiency and physician well-being.
