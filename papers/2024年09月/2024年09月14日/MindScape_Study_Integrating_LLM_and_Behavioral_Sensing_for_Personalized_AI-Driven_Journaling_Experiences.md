> MindScape Study: Integrating LLM and Behavioral Sensing for Personalized AI-Driven Journaling Experiences

# 摘要

> 大学生心理健康问题普遍，急需提升自我意识和整体福祉的干预措施。MindScape 创新性地将被动收集的行为数据（如对话、睡眠和位置）与大型语言模型结合，打造个性化、情境感知的 AI 日记体验，增强自我意识和福祉。我们为期 8 周的研究显示，MindScape 应用有效提升积极情绪 7%，降低消极情绪 11%，孤独感 6%，焦虑和抑郁症状显著减轻，PHQ-4 评分每周下降 0.25，正念和自我反思分别提升 7% 和 6%。参与者特别赞赏其个性化提示和见解。研究还比较了情境与通用提示的效果，并提出利用情境 AI 日记改善校园福祉的策略。通过展示其潜力，我们为深入研究情境 AI 日记对心理健康的影响奠定了基础。

> Mental health concerns are prevalent among college students, highlighting the need for effective interventions that promote self-awareness and holistic well-being. MindScape pioneers a novel approach to AI-powered journaling by integrating passively collected behavioral patterns such as conversational engagement, sleep, and location with Large Language Models (LLMs). This integration creates a highly personalized and context-aware journaling experience, enhancing self-awareness and well-being by embedding behavioral intelligence into AI. We present an 8-week exploratory study with 20 college students, demonstrating the MindScape app's efficacy in enhancing positive affect (7%), reducing negative affect (11%), loneliness (6%), and anxiety and depression, with a significant week-over-week decrease in PHQ-4 scores (-0.25 coefficient), alongside improvements in mindfulness (7%) and self-reflection (6%). The study highlights the advantages of contextual AI journaling, with participants particularly appreciating the tailored prompts and insights provided by the MindScape app. Our analysis also includes a comparison of responses to AI-driven contextual versus generic prompts, participant feedback insights, and proposed strategies for leveraging contextual AI journaling to improve well-being on college campuses. By showcasing the potential of contextual AI journaling to support mental health, we provide a foundation for further investigation into the effects of contextual AI journaling on mental health and well-being.
