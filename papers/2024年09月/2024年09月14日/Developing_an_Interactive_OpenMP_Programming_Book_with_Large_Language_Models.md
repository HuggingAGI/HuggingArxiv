# 摘要

> 本文探讨了如何利用大型语言模型（LLM）编写《交互式OpenMP编程》教材。我们使用了包括 Gemini Pro 1.5、Claude 3 和 ChatGPT-4 在内的先进 LLM，生成了书籍的结构、大纲及各章节的初稿，涵盖了 OpenMP 的详细解释和编程实例。随后，这些内容经过精心修订，以确保符合教学目标。研究发现，尽管 LLM 在生成教材内容方面表现出色，但仍需与传统教学方法结合，以保证内容的深度与准确性。《交互式OpenMP编程》采用 Jupyter Book 框架，支持在网页中直接运行代码，提供即时反馈，为学习者带来动态体验。这不仅是对传统教育资源的革新，也为利用 AI 工具编写教材提供了实用参考。

> This paper presents an approach to authoring a textbook titled Interactive OpenMP Programming with the assistance of Large Language Models (LLMs). The writing process utilized state-of-the-art LLMs, including Gemini Pro 1.5, Claude 3, and ChatGPT-4, to generate the initial structure and outline of the book, as well as the initial content for specific chapters. This content included detailed descriptions of individual OpenMP constructs and practical programming examples. The outline and content have then undergone extensive manual revisions to meet our book goals. In this paper, we report our findings about the capabilities and limitations of these LLMs. We address critical questions concerning the necessity of textbook resources and the effectiveness of LLMs in creating fundamental and practical programming content. Our findings suggest that while LLMs offer significant advantages in generating textbook content, they require careful integration with traditional educational methodologies to ensure depth, accuracy, and pedagogical effectiveness. The Interactive OpenMP Programming book is developed with the framework of Jupyter Book, enabling the execution of code within the book from the web browser, providing instant feedback and a dynamic learning experience that stands in contrast to traditional educational resources. The book represents a significant step towards modernizing programming education, offering insights into practical strategies for generating the textbook through advanced AI tools.
