> AI-Driven Virtual Teacher for Enhanced Educational Efficiency: Leveraging Large Pretrain Models for Autonomous Error Analysis and Correction

# 摘要

> 学生在数学解题时常犯错，传统纠错方法既耗时又费力。本文介绍了一款创新的虚拟AI教师系统（VATE），利用大型语言模型（LLM）自主分析和纠正学生错误。该系统以学生草稿为主要分析源，深入理解学习过程，结合精妙的提示工程和错误池，降低计算负担。AI驱动的系统还具备实时对话功能，提升学生互动效率。相比传统和机器学习纠错方法，VATE在降低成本、高扩展性和泛化性方面优势显著。该系统已在松鼠AI平台的小学数学教育中应用，错误分析准确率达78.3%，大幅提升学习效率。满意度调查显示强烈好评，预示着教育实践的革新潜力。

> Students frequently make mistakes while solving mathematical problems, and traditional error correction methods are both time-consuming and labor-intensive. This paper introduces an innovative \textbf{V}irtual \textbf{A}I \textbf{T}eacher system designed to autonomously analyze and correct student \textbf{E}rrors (VATE). Leveraging advanced large language models (LLMs), the system uses student drafts as a primary source for error analysis, which enhances understanding of the student's learning process. It incorporates sophisticated prompt engineering and maintains an error pool to reduce computational overhead. The AI-driven system also features a real-time dialogue component for efficient student interaction. Our approach demonstrates significant advantages over traditional and machine learning-based error correction methods, including reduced educational costs, high scalability, and superior generalizability. The system has been deployed on the Squirrel AI learning platform for elementary mathematics education, where it achieves 78.3\% accuracy in error analysis and shows a marked improvement in student learning efficiency. Satisfaction surveys indicate a strong positive reception, highlighting the system's potential to transform educational practices.
