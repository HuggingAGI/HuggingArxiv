# 摘要

> 音乐在日常生活中不可或缺，它满足我们的情感和娱乐需求，并在个人、社会和文化层面建立联系。深入理解音乐能提升我们的情感体验、认知能力及文化认同。随着人工智能的飞速发展，分析音乐的新方法应运而生，旨在模拟人类对音乐的理解并提供相关服务。传统模型侧重于音频特征和简单任务，而大型语言模型和基础模型通过整合语义信息和强大的推理能力，能够捕捉复杂的音乐特征和模式，将音乐与语言融合，并融入丰富的音乐、情感和心理知识。因此，它们在从语义角度处理复杂音乐理解任务方面潜力巨大，输出更贴近人类感知。据我们所知，这项工作是早期探讨 AI 技术与音乐理解交叉领域的综述之一。我们深入研究了最新的大规模音乐基础模型，分析了它们的音乐理解能力，并探讨了其局限性及未来发展方向，为该领域的研究者提供了宝贵见解。

> Music is essential in daily life, fulfilling emotional and entertainment needs, and connecting us personally, socially, and culturally. A better understanding of music can enhance our emotions, cognitive skills, and cultural connections. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced new ways to analyze music, aiming to replicate human understanding of music and provide related services. While the traditional models focused on audio features and simple tasks, the recent development of large language models (LLMs) and foundation models (FMs), which excel in various fields by integrating semantic information and demonstrating strong reasoning abilities, could capture complex musical features and patterns, integrate music with language and incorporate rich musical, emotional and psychological knowledge. Therefore, they have the potential in handling complex music understanding tasks from a semantic perspective, producing outputs closer to human perception. This work, to our best knowledge, is one of the early reviews of the intersection of AI techniques and music understanding. We investigated, analyzed, and tested recent large-scale music foundation models in respect of their music comprehension abilities. We also discussed their limitations and proposed possible future directions, offering insights for researchers in this field.
