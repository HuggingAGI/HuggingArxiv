> Synergistic Simulations: Multi-Agent Problem Solving with Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型 (LLM) 不仅在多代理系统开发中大放异彩，还能与模拟环境互动。本文将代理与世界交互结合，设计了一个模拟，让多个代理合作解决问题，模拟人类群体的协作优势。我们通过两个实验——室友共居和编程任务合作，展示了 LLM 的协作潜力。这不仅为多代理框架提供了新视角，也为未来研究指明了方向。

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly demonstrated the ability to facilitate the development of multi-agent systems that allow the interpretation of thoughts and actions generated by each individual. Promising advancements have also been made in LLM-based interaction with existing worlds, particularly in interacting with simulated environments. This paper aims to integrate both aforementioned topics (agents & world interaction) into a single simulation where multiple agents can work together to solve a problem, modeling how groups of humans can often solve problems better than individuals. By showing whether LLMs demonstrate the synergy of human collaboration, it could lead to advancements in the applications of LLMs. We implemented two simulations: a physical studio apartment with two roommates, and another where agents collaborate to complete a programming task. We provide a multi-agent framework, discuss the performance of the agents in each simulation, and discuss potential future additions.
