> Synergistic Simulations: Multi-Agent Problem Solving with Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型 (LLM) 不仅在多代理系统开发中大放异彩，还能与模拟环境互动。本文将代理与世界交互结合，创建了一个模拟，展示多个代理如何协作解决问题，就像人类团队通常比个人更高效一样。我们设计了两个模拟：一个是两位室友共住的工作室公寓，另一个是代理合作编程。通过这些实验，我们不仅构建了多代理框架，还探讨了其性能，并展望了未来的发展方向。

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly demonstrated the ability to facilitate the development of multi-agent systems that allow the interpretation of thoughts and actions generated by each individual. Promising advancements have also been made in LLM-based interaction with existing worlds, particularly in interacting with simulated environments. This paper aims to integrate both aforementioned topics (agents & world interaction) into a single simulation where multiple agents can work together to solve a problem, modeling how groups of humans can often solve problems better than individuals. By showing whether LLMs demonstrate the synergy of human collaboration, it could lead to advancements in the applications of LLMs. We implemented two simulations: a physical studio apartment with two roommates, and another where agents collaborate to complete a programming task. We provide a multi-agent framework, discuss the performance of the agents in each simulation, and discuss potential future additions.
