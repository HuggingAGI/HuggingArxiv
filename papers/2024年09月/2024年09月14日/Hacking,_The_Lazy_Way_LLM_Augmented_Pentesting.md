> Hacking, The Lazy Way: LLM Augmented Pentesting

# 摘要

> 安全研究人员需不断追赶快速变化的网络安全领域，这包括学习新知、遗忘旧识和重新学习，再加上繁琐的文档筛选和数据分析，常使生产力和创新受阻。结果是，只有资源雄厚的组织才能聘请顶级专家，而其他组织只能依赖于主要关注合规性的次级研究人员。为此，我们推出了“LLM增强渗透测试”，通过“Pentest Copilot”工具实现。该方法将大型语言模型融入渗透测试流程，采用“思维链”机制优化令牌使用并提升性能，同时通过独特的检索增强生成技术减少幻觉，确保模型与最新技术同步。我们还提出了一种创新的文件分析方法，使LLM能理解文件内容。此外，我们设计了一个支持浏览器内辅助渗透测试的基础设施系统，为网络安全专业人员提供强大平台。这些创新举措在自动化工具与人类专家之间架起了桥梁，为现代网络安全团队提供了有力支持。

> Security researchers are continually challenged by the need to stay current with rapidly evolving cybersecurity research, tools, and techniques. This constant cycle of learning, unlearning, and relearning, combined with the repetitive tasks of sifting through documentation and analyzing data, often hinders productivity and innovation. This has led to a disparity where only organizations with substantial resources can access top-tier security experts, while others rely on firms with less skilled researchers who focus primarily on compliance rather than actual security.
  We introduce "LLM Augmented Pentesting," demonstrated through a tool named "Pentest Copilot," to address this gap. This approach integrates Large Language Models into penetration testing workflows. Our research includes a "chain of thought" mechanism to streamline token usage and boost performance, as well as unique Retrieval Augmented Generation implementation to minimize hallucinations and keep models aligned with the latest techniques. Additionally, we propose a novel file analysis approach, enabling LLMs to understand files. Furthermore, we highlight a unique infrastructure system that supports if implemented, can support in-browser assisted penetration testing, offering a robust platform for cybersecurity professionals, These advancements mark a significant step toward bridging the gap between automated tools and human expertise, offering a powerful solution to the challenges faced by modern cybersecurity teams.
