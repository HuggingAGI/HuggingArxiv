> From Experts to the Public: Governing Multimodal Language Models in Politically Sensitive Video Analysis

# 摘要

> 本文通过个人与集体审议，探讨了多模态大型语言模型 (MM-LLM) 的治理，特别是政治敏感视频的分析。我们首先采访了10名记者，了解专家对视频的解读；随后，114名公众通过 Inclusive.AI 平台进行审议，该平台利用 DAO 机制促进民主决策。研究发现，专家侧重情感与叙事，而公众更关注事实清晰、情境客观及情感中立。我们还比较了二次方与加权投票、平等与20-80权力分配对 AI 行为决策的影响。结果显示，二次方投票提升了自由民主与政治平等的感知，对 AI 持乐观态度的参与者认为投票更具参与民主性。这表明 DAO 机制在民主化 AI 治理中具有潜力。

> This paper examines the governance of multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs) through individual and collective deliberation, focusing on analyses of politically sensitive videos. We conducted a two-step study: first, interviews with 10 journalists established a baseline understanding of expert video interpretation; second, 114 individuals from the general public engaged in deliberation using Inclusive.AI, a platform that facilitates democratic decision-making through decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) mechanisms. Our findings show that while experts emphasized emotion and narrative, the general public prioritized factual clarity, objectivity of the situation, and emotional neutrality. Additionally, we explored the impact of different governance mechanisms: quadratic vs. weighted ranking voting and equal vs. 20-80 power distributions on users decision-making on how AI should behave. Specifically, quadratic voting enhanced perceptions of liberal democracy and political equality, and participants who were more optimistic about AI perceived the voting process to have a higher level of participatory democracy. Our results suggest the potential of applying DAO mechanisms to help democratize AI governance.
