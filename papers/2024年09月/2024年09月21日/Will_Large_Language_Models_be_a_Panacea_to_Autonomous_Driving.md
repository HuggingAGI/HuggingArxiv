> 人工智能在自动驾驶研究中至关重要，推动其向智能化和高效化发展。当前，自动驾驶技术主要沿两条路径发展：模块化和端到端。模块化将驾驶任务分解为多个模块分别训练，但模块间目标不一致导致集成效果不佳。端到端则尝试通过单一模型直接处理传感器数据到控制信号，但难以应对复杂场景和长尾事件。面对这些挑战，许多研究者认为，具有强大推理能力和广泛知识的大型语言模型（LLMs）可能是解决方案，期待其为自动驾驶系统提供更深层次的理解和决策能力。本文深入分析了LLMs在自动驾驶中的潜在应用，探讨了其在模块化和端到端方法中的优化策略，并特别关注LLMs如何解决当前解决方案中的问题和挑战。此外，我们探讨了一个关键问题：基于LLM的人工通用智能（AGI）是否是实现高级自动驾驶的关键？同时，我们也分析了LLMs在推动自动驾驶技术发展中可能遇到的潜在限制和挑战。

> Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving (AD) research, propelling its development towards intelligence and efficiency. Currently, the development of AD technology follows two main technical paths: modularization and end-to-end. Modularization decompose the driving task into modules such as perception, prediction, planning, and control, and train them separately. Due to the inconsistency of training objectives between modules, the integrated effect suffers from bias. End-to-end attempts to address this issue by utilizing a single model that directly maps from sensor data to control signals. This path has limited learning capabilities in a comprehensive set of features and struggles to handle unpredictable long-tail events and complex urban traffic scenarios. In the face of challenges encountered in both paths, many researchers believe that large language models (LLMs) with powerful reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge understanding may be the solution, expecting LLMs to provide AD systems with deeper levels of understanding and decision-making capabilities. In light of the challenges faced by both paths, many researchers believe that LLMs, with their powerful reasoning abilities and extensive knowledge, could offer a solution. To understand if LLMs could enhance AD, this paper conducts a thorough analysis of the potential applications of LLMs in AD systems, including exploring their optimization strategies in both modular and end-to-end approaches, with a particular focus on how LLMs can tackle the problems and challenges present in current solutions. Furthermore, we discuss an important question: Can LLM-based artificial general intelligence (AGI) be a key to achieve high-level AD? We further analyze the potential limitations and challenges that LLMs may encounter in promoting the development of AD technology.
