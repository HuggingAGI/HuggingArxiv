> Current Trends and Future Directions for Sexual Health Conversational Agents (CAs) for Youth: A Scoping Review

# 摘要

> 对话代理（聊天机器人）能够通过自然对话与用户互动。尽管性健康领域的研究多聚焦于成人，但这些发现未必适用于青少年。本研究旨在全面评估针对青少年的性健康聊天机器人的最新进展。根据PRISMA指南，我们综合了过去14年间的相关研究。结果显示，多数性健康聊天机器人以健康专家的身份出现，主要提供一般性健康信息。文本是其主要沟通方式，半数支持多媒体输出。许多聊天机器人采用规则驱动的方法传递专家知识，但安全功能普遍缺失。青少年虽欣赏其无偏见、保密的对话环境，却认为现有聊天机器人提供的性健康信息有限，未能涵盖性或性别少数群体。我们的综述指出了这些聊天机器人需进一步改进的领域，并强调了未来研究的方向。尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）为这些技术带来新机遇，但隐私与安全仍是重中之重。此外，制定针对青少年的性健康聊天机器人的风险缓解和伦理开发的最佳实践势在必行。

> Conversational Agents (CAs, chatbots) are systems with the ability to interact with users using natural human dialogue. While much of the research on CAs for sexual health has focused on adult populations, the insights from such research may not apply to CAs for youth. The study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the state-of-the-art research on sexual health CAs for youth. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we synthesized peer-reviewed studies specific to sexual health CAs designed for youth over the past 14 years. We found that most sexual health CAs were designed to adopt the persona of health professionals to provide general sexual and reproductive health information for youth. Text was the primary communication mode in all sexual health CAs, with half supporting multimedia output. Many sexual health CAs employed rule-based techniques to deliver pre-written expert knowledge on sexual health; yet most sexual health CAs did not have the safety features in place. While youth appreciated accessibility to non-judgmental and confidential conversations about sexual health topics, they perceived current sexual health CAs provided limited sexual health information that is not inclusive of sexual and/or gender minorities. Our review brings to light sexual health CAs needing further development and evaluation and we identify multiple important areas for future work. While the new trend of large language models (LLMs) based CAs can make such technologies more feasible, the privacy and safety of the systems should be prioritized. Finally, best practices for risk mitigation and ethical development of sexual health CAs with and for youth are needed.
