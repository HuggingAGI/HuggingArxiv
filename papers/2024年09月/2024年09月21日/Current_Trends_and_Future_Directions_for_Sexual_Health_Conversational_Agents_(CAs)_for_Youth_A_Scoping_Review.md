> Current Trends and Future Directions for Sexual Health Conversational Agents (CAs) for Youth: A Scoping Review

# 摘要

> 对话代理（聊天机器人）能够通过自然对话与用户互动。虽然针对性健康的研究多集中在成人群体，但这些见解未必适用于青少年。本研究全面评估了青少年性健康聊天机器人的最新进展。根据PRISMA指南，我们综合了过去14年的相关研究。结果显示，多数性健康聊天机器人扮演健康专家角色，提供一般性健康信息。文本是其主要沟通方式，半数支持多媒体输出。许多机器人采用规则技术传递专家知识，但大多缺乏安全功能。青少年虽赞赏无偏见、保密的对话，但认为现有机器人信息有限，未涵盖性或性别少数群体。我们的综述指出，这些机器人需进一步开发和评估，并强调未来需关注隐私和安全。此外，针对青少年的性健康聊天机器人的风险缓解和伦理开发最佳实践亟待制定。

> Conversational Agents (CAs, chatbots) are systems with the ability to interact with users using natural human dialogue. While much of the research on CAs for sexual health has focused on adult populations, the insights from such research may not apply to CAs for youth. The study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the state-of-the-art research on sexual health CAs for youth. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we synthesized peer-reviewed studies specific to sexual health CAs designed for youth over the past 14 years. We found that most sexual health CAs were designed to adopt the persona of health professionals to provide general sexual and reproductive health information for youth. Text was the primary communication mode in all sexual health CAs, with half supporting multimedia output. Many sexual health CAs employed rule-based techniques to deliver pre-written expert knowledge on sexual health; yet most sexual health CAs did not have the safety features in place. While youth appreciated accessibility to non-judgmental and confidential conversations about sexual health topics, they perceived current sexual health CAs provided limited sexual health information that is not inclusive of sexual and/or gender minorities. Our review brings to light sexual health CAs needing further development and evaluation and we identify multiple important areas for future work. While the new trend of large language models (LLMs) based CAs can make such technologies more feasible, the privacy and safety of the systems should be prioritized. Finally, best practices for risk mitigation and ethical development of sexual health CAs with and for youth are needed.
