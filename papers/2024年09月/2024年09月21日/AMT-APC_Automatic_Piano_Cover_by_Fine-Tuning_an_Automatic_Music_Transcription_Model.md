Abstract:There have been several studies on automatically generating piano covers, and recent advancements in deep learning have enabled the creation of more sophisticated covers. However, existing automatic piano cover models still have room for improvement in terms of expressiveness and fidelity to the original. To address these issues, we propose a learning algorithm called AMT-APC, which leverages the capabilities of automatic music transcription models. By utilizing the strengths of well-established automatic music transcription models, we aim to improve the accuracy of piano cover generation. Our experiments demonstrate that the AMT-APC model reproduces original tracks more accurately than any existing models.
