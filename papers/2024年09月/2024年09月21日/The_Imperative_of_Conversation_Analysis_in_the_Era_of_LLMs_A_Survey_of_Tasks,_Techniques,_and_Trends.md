> The Imperative of Conversation Analysis in the Era of LLMs: A Survey of Tasks, Techniques, and Trends

# 摘要

> 在 LLM 时代，随着语言 UI 的迅猛发展，大量对话日志应运而生。对话分析 (CA) 旨在从这些数据中提炼关键信息，优化人工流程，助力商业洞察与决策。CA 的重要性日益凸显，但其范围模糊导致技术分散，难以形成系统合力。本文系统梳理了 CA 任务，正式定义其范畴，并提出从场景重建到深入分析，再到针对性训练，最终生成对话的四大步骤。此外，我们还探讨了相关基准、潜在挑战及未来方向。当前研究多聚焦于浅层对话元素，与实际业务需求存在差距。借助 LLM，研究正转向因果关系与高级策略任务。这些分析成果将在对话日志驱动的商业运营中发挥更大价值。

> In the era of large language models (LLMs), a vast amount of conversation logs will be accumulated thanks to the rapid development trend of language UI. Conversation Analysis (CA) strives to uncover and analyze critical information from conversation data, streamlining manual processes and supporting business insights and decision-making. The need for CA to extract actionable insights and drive empowerment is becoming increasingly prominent and attracting widespread attention. However, the lack of a clear scope for CA leads to a dispersion of various techniques, making it difficult to form a systematic technical synergy to empower business applications. In this paper, we perform a thorough review and systematize CA task to summarize the existing related work. Specifically, we formally define CA task to confront the fragmented and chaotic landscape in this field, and derive four key steps of CA from conversation scene reconstruction, to in-depth attribution analysis, and then to performing targeted training, finally generating conversations based on the targeted training for achieving the specific goals. In addition, we showcase the relevant benchmarks, discuss potential challenges and point out future directions in both industry and academia. In view of current advancements, it is evident that the majority of efforts are still concentrated on the analysis of shallow conversation elements, which presents a considerable gap between the research and business, and with the assist of LLMs, recent work has shown a trend towards research on causality and strategic tasks which are sophisticated and high-level. The analyzed experiences and insights will inevitably have broader application value in business operations that target conversation logs.
