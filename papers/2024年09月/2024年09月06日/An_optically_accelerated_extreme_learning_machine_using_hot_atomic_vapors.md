> 机器学习因其解决多样化社会问题的能力而迅速普及，但其应用和资源需求正受到现有硬件技术的限制。特别是，大型语言模型和高分辨率图像识别等新兴领域，对计算时间和能源成本提出了挑战。为此，光学平台应运而生，旨在为机器学习提供更高效的硬件。其中，光学自由空间传播以其并行性、低能耗和高速计算的优势脱颖而出。我们提出了一种结合热原子蒸汽中光束非线性特性和极端学习机模型的新设计，并通过MNIST图像分类任务的数值和实验验证了其训练效果的提升。此外，我们还指出了可进一步优化的实验超参数，以期提高平台的准确性。

> Machine learning is becoming a widely used technique with a impressive growth due to the diversity of problem of societal interest where it can offer practical solutions. This increase of applications and required resources start to become limited by present day hardware technologies. Indeed, novel machine learning subjects such as large language models or high resolution image recognition raise the question of large computing time and energy cost of the required computation. In this context, optical platforms have been designed for several years with the goal of developing more efficient hardware for machine learning. Among different explored platforms, optical free-space propagation offers various advantages: parallelism, low energy cost and computational speed. Here, we present a new design combining the strong and tunable nonlinear properties of a light beam propagating through a hot atomic vapor with an Extreme Learning Machine model. We numerically and experimentally demonstrate the enhancement of the training using such free-space nonlinear propagation on a MNIST image classification task. We point out different experimental hyperparameters that can be further optimized to improve the accuracy of the platform.
