# 摘要

> 扩大深度学习模型的规模是提升机器学习模型智能的有效途径，尤其在工业推荐和大型语言模型中表现突出。分布式系统和算法的协同设计对最大化训练性能至关重要。然而，随着规模扩大，超参数数量激增，寻找最佳配置变得更具挑战性。为此，我们提出CubicML，利用机器学习自动优化分布式系统的训练性能。CubicML通过代理模型预测训练性能，提升搜索效率和建模灵活性。实验证明，CubicML能显著加速Meta内部广告推荐和大型语言模型的训练。

> Scaling up deep learning models has been proven effective to improve intelligence of machine learning (ML) models, especially for industry recommendation models and large language models. The co-design of distributed ML systems and algorithms (to maximize training performance) plays a pivotal role for its success. As it scales, the number of co-design hyper-parameters grows rapidly which brings challenges to feasibly find the optimal setup for system performance maximization. In this paper, we propose CubicML which uses ML to automatically optimize training performance of distributed ML systems. In CubicML, we use a ML model as a proxy to predict the training performance for search efficiency and performance modeling flexibility. We proved that CubicML can effectively optimize training speed of in-house ads recommendation models and large language models at Meta.
