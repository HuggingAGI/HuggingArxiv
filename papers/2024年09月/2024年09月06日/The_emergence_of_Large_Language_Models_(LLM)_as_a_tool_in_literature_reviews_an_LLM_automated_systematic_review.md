> The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) as a tool in literature reviews: an LLM automated systematic review

# 摘要

> 本研究旨在总结在科学评论创建过程中使用大型语言模型（LLMs）的情况。我们探讨了评论中可自动化的各个阶段，并评估了当前最先进的研究项目。2024年6月，人类评论员在多个数据库中进行了搜索，筛选和提取过程借助LLM插件完成。ChatGPT用于数据清理和图表代码生成，并协助起草手稿。结果显示，ChatGPT和基于GPT的LLM在审查自动化中占主导地位，但实际使用LLM的评论论文较少。大多数研究集中在特定阶段的自动化，如搜索和数据提取。基于GPT的模型在数据提取中表现优异，但在标题和摘要筛选中略显不足。我们的研究发现，LLM在审查自动化中的应用前景广阔，预计将改变未来的科学评论方式。

> Objective: This study aims to summarize the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the process of creating a scientific review. We look at the range of stages in a review that can be automated and assess the current state-of-the-art research projects in the field. Materials and Methods: The search was conducted in June 2024 in PubMed, Scopus, Dimensions, and Google Scholar databases by human reviewers. Screening and extraction process took place in Covidence with the help of LLM add-on which uses OpenAI gpt-4o model. ChatGPT was used to clean extracted data and generate code for figures in this manuscript, ChatGPT and Scite.ai were used in drafting all components of the manuscript, except the methods and discussion sections. Results: 3,788 articles were retrieved, and 172 studies were deemed eligible for the final review. ChatGPT and GPT-based LLM emerged as the most dominant architecture for review automation (n=126, 73.2%). A significant number of review automation projects were found, but only a limited number of papers (n=26, 15.1%) were actual reviews that used LLM during their creation. Most citations focused on automation of a particular stage of review, such as Searching for publications (n=60, 34.9%), and Data extraction (n=54, 31.4%). When comparing pooled performance of GPT-based and BERT-based models, the former were better in data extraction with mean precision 83.0% (SD=10.4), and recall 86.0% (SD=9.8), while being slightly less accurate in title and abstract screening stage (Maccuracy=77.3%, SD=13.0). Discussion/Conclusion: Our LLM-assisted systematic review revealed a significant number of research projects related to review automation using LLMs. The results looked promising, and we anticipate that LLMs will change in the near future the way the scientific reviews are conducted.
