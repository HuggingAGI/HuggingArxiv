# 摘要

> 在复杂场景中，关系抽取 (RE) 因关系类型多样和实体间关系模糊而挑战重重，影响了传统 "文本输入，文本输出" 语言模型的性能。为此，我们提出了基于代理的 RE 框架 AgentRE，该框架通过整合大型语言模型的记忆、检索和反思能力，有效应对这些挑战。AgentRE 包含三大模块，助力代理高效获取并处理信息，显著提升 RE 性能。实验表明，AgentRE 在低资源环境下表现卓越，并能生成高质量训练数据，用于优化小型模型。详细代码请访问 https://github.com/Lightblues/AgentRE。

> The relation extraction (RE) in complex scenarios faces challenges such as diverse relation types and ambiguous relations between entities within a single sentence, leading to the poor performance of pure "text-in, text-out" language models (LMs). To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an agent-based RE framework, namely AgentRE, which fully leverages the potential of large language models (LLMs) including memory, retrieval and reflection, to achieve RE in complex scenarios. Specifically, three major modules are built in AgentRE serving as the tools to help the agent acquire and process various useful information, thereby obtaining improved RE performance. Our extensive experimental results upon two datasets in English and Chinese demonstrate our AgentRE's superior performance, especially in low-resource scenarios. Additionally, the trajectories generated by AgentRE can be refined to construct a high-quality training dataset incorporating different reasoning methods, which can be used to fine-tune smaller models.
