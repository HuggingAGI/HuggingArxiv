> Do Large Language Models Possess Sensitive to Sentiment?

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型 (LLMs) 在语言理解方面展现了卓越能力，但全面评估其情感能力仍具挑战。本文探讨了 LLMs 在文本中识别和响应情感的能力。随着 LLMs 在多领域应用中的普及，理解其对情感的敏感性变得至关重要，这直接影响用户体验和情感驱动任务的效果。我们通过一系列实验，评估了多个知名 LLMs 在处理正面、负面和中性情感时的表现。实验结果显示，尽管 LLMs 对情感有一定敏感度，但在准确性和一致性上存在显著差异，这表明需要进一步优化训练过程以更好地捕捉情感细微差别。例如，模型有时会将强烈正面情感误判为中性，或未能识别文本中的讽刺和反讽。这些误判揭示了情感分析的复杂性及模型改进的必要性。此外，不同 LLMs 在相同数据集上的表现差异，也提示我们需深入研究影响性能的因素及其优化方法。

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently displayed their extraordinary capabilities in language understanding. However, how to comprehensively assess the sentiment capabilities of LLMs continues to be a challenge. This paper investigates the ability of LLMs to detect and react to sentiment in text modal. As the integration of LLMs into diverse applications is on the rise, it becomes highly critical to comprehend their sensitivity to emotional tone, as it can influence the user experience and the efficacy of sentiment-driven tasks. We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of several prominent LLMs in identifying and responding appropriately to sentiments like positive, negative, and neutral emotions. The models' outputs are analyzed across various sentiment benchmarks, and their responses are compared with human evaluations. Our discoveries indicate that although LLMs show a basic sensitivity to sentiment, there are substantial variations in their accuracy and consistency, emphasizing the requirement for further enhancements in their training processes to better capture subtle emotional cues. Take an example in our findings, in some cases, the models might wrongly classify a strongly positive sentiment as neutral, or fail to recognize sarcasm or irony in the text. Such misclassifications highlight the complexity of sentiment analysis and the areas where the models need to be refined. Another aspect is that different LLMs might perform differently on the same set of data, depending on their architecture and training datasets. This variance calls for a more in-depth study of the factors that contribute to the performance differences and how they can be optimized.
