# 摘要

> 在人机交互领域，焦点小组虽广泛应用，但资源消耗大，需专业主持人及周密准备。本研究创新推出“焦点代理”，一大型语言模型驱动的框架，模拟焦点小组并主持人类参与的讨论。我们组织五次会议，23名人类与AI参与者，定量分析显示，焦点代理能产出与人类相仿的见解。研究还揭示了LLM在主持含人类参与的讨论时的一些进步空间。

> In the domain of Human-Computer Interaction, focus groups represent a widely utilised yet resource-intensive methodology, often demanding the expertise of skilled moderators and meticulous preparatory efforts. This study introduces the ``Focus Agent,'' a Large Language Model (LLM) powered framework that simulates both the focus group (for data collection) and acts as a moderator in a focus group setting with human participants. To assess the data quality derived from the Focus Agent, we ran five focus group sessions with a total of 23 human participants as well as deploying the Focus Agent to simulate these discussions with AI participants. Quantitative analysis indicates that Focus Agent can generate opinions similar to those of human participants. Furthermore, the research exposes some improvements associated with LLMs acting as moderators in focus group discussions that include human participants.
