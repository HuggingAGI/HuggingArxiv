> Abstractive Text Summarization: State of the Art, Challenges, and Improvements

# 摘要

> 本调查聚焦于抽象文本摘要领域，而非抽取技术，提供了一个详尽的概览，深入探讨了最新技术、常见挑战及未来研究方向。技术分类包括传统序列到序列模型、预训练大型语言模型、强化学习、分层方法及多模态摘要。与以往研究不同，本次回顾全面涵盖了最先进方法、挑战、解决方案、比较、局限性，并展望未来改进，为研究人员提供了广泛视角，以推动抽象摘要研究进展。我们提供了跨技术分类的关键比较表，揭示模型复杂性、可扩展性及适用场景。论文强调了意义表示不足、事实一致性、可控文本摘要、跨语言摘要及评估指标等挑战，并提出利用知识整合等创新策略的解决方案。最后，论文强调了事实不一致、特定领域、跨语言、多语言及长文档摘要等新兴研究领域，以及处理噪声数据的重要性。我们的目标是为研究人员和实践者提供该领域的结构化概览，助力他们深入理解现状，并探索进一步研究和改进的可能领域。

> Specifically focusing on the landscape of abstractive text summarization, as opposed to extractive techniques, this survey presents a comprehensive overview, delving into state-of-the-art techniques, prevailing challenges, and prospective research directions. We categorize the techniques into traditional sequence-to-sequence models, pre-trained large language models, reinforcement learning, hierarchical methods, and multi-modal summarization. Unlike prior works that did not examine complexities, scalability and comparisons of techniques in detail, this review takes a comprehensive approach encompassing state-of-the-art methods, challenges, solutions, comparisons, limitations and charts out future improvements - providing researchers an extensive overview to advance abstractive summarization research. We provide vital comparison tables across techniques categorized - offering insights into model complexity, scalability and appropriate applications. The paper highlights challenges such as inadequate meaning representation, factual consistency, controllable text summarization, cross-lingual summarization, and evaluation metrics, among others. Solutions leveraging knowledge incorporation and other innovative strategies are proposed to address these challenges. The paper concludes by highlighting emerging research areas like factual inconsistency, domain-specific, cross-lingual, multilingual, and long-document summarization, as well as handling noisy data. Our objective is to provide researchers and practitioners with a structured overview of the domain, enabling them to better understand the current landscape and identify potential areas for further research and improvement.
