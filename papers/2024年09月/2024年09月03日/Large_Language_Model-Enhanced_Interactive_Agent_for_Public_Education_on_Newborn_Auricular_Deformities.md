> Large Language Model-Enhanced Interactive Agent for Public Education on Newborn Auricular Deformities

# 摘要

> 耳部畸形在新生儿中相当常见，可能带来长期的心理和听力问题。早期诊断和治疗至关重要，但常因父母缺乏知识而缺失。借助百度Ernie大型语言模型，我们开发了一个智能互动代理。它能通过PaddleDetection识别耳部畸形类型，准确率达75%，并能向父母提供专业建议。通过志愿者测试和对照组评估，该代理在偏远农村地区也能提供高质量的远程医疗诊断和专业问答服务，为新生儿耳部畸形及其他需早期干预的疾病带来福音。

> Auricular deformities are quite common in newborns with potential long-term negative effects of mental and even hearing problems.Early diagnosis and subsequent treatment are critical for the illness; yet they are missing most of the time due to lack of knowledge among parents. With the help of large language model of Ernie of Baidu Inc., we derive a realization of interactive agent. Firstly, it is intelligent enough to detect which type of auricular deformity corresponding to uploaded images, which is accomplished by PaddleDetection, with precision rate 75\%. Secondly, in terms of popularizing the knowledge of auricular deformities, the agent can give professional suggestions of the illness to parents. The above two effects are evaluated via tests on volunteers with control groups in the paper. The agent can reach parents with newborns as well as their pediatrician remotely via Internet in vast, rural areas with quality medical diagnosis capabilities and professional query-answering functions, which is good news for newborn auricular deformity and other illness that requires early intervention for better treatment.
