# 摘要

> 计算机系统创造力是实现AGI的关键，但由于人类创造力的复杂性，这一能力在软件中的开发颇具挑战。尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）模仿了创造力和感知，它们实际上并不具备这些特质。尽管LLMs偶尔无意中创造出新内容，如产生有害幻觉，其刻意创造力仍被认为不及人类。为此，本文提出了一种通过迭代概念注入与细化来提升LLM创造力的方法。我们初步开发了CAIRDD系统，并评估了其核心组件的有效性，旨在推动创造性人工智能的发展。

> Computer system creativity is a key step on the pathway to artificial general intelligence (AGI). It is elusive, however, due to the fact that human creativity is not fully understood and, thus, it is difficult to develop this capability in software. Large language models (LLMs) provide a facsimile of creativity and the appearance of sentience, while not actually being either creative or sentient. While LLMs have created bona fide new content, in some cases - such as with harmful hallucinations - inadvertently, their deliberate creativity is seen by some to not match that of humans. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes a technique for enhancing LLM output creativity via an iterative process of concept injection and refinement. Initial work on the development of the Creative Artificial Intelligence through Recurring Developments and Determinations (CAIRDD) system is presented and the efficacy of key system components is evaluated.
