> How Privacy-Savvy Are Large Language Models? A Case Study on Compliance and Privacy Technical Review

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLM）在语言生成、摘要和复杂问答等多个领域的应用已显著扩展。然而，其在隐私合规和技术审查方面的应用尚待深入探索，这引发了对其遵守全球隐私标准和保护用户敏感数据能力的重大关切。本文通过全面案例研究，评估了LLM在隐私信息提取、法律与法规关键点检测及隐私政策问答等任务中的表现。我们提出了一个隐私技术审查框架（PTR），强调其在软件开发过程中降低隐私风险的作用。实证研究表明，包括BERT、GPT-3.5、GPT-4在内的多个LLM在执行隐私合规检查和技术审查方面表现出色，尤其在提取敏感信息和检测法规合规点方面，其精确度、召回率和F1分数均表现优异。尽管LLM在自动化隐私审查和识别法规差异方面潜力巨大，但在完全符合不断演变的法律标准方面仍存在差距。为此，我们提出了增强LLM隐私合规能力的具体建议，强调模型改进和与法律要求的深度整合的重要性。本研究凸显了开发既能助力企业合规又能保护用户隐私权的隐私感知LLM的紧迫性和重要性。

> The recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly expanded their applications across various fields such as language generation, summarization, and complex question answering. However, their application to privacy compliance and technical privacy reviews remains under-explored, raising critical concerns about their ability to adhere to global privacy standards and protect sensitive user data. This paper seeks to address this gap by providing a comprehensive case study evaluating LLMs' performance in privacy-related tasks such as privacy information extraction (PIE), legal and regulatory key point detection (KPD), and question answering (QA) with respect to privacy policies and data protection regulations. We introduce a Privacy Technical Review (PTR) framework, highlighting its role in mitigating privacy risks during the software development life-cycle. Through an empirical assessment, we investigate the capacity of several prominent LLMs, including BERT, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and custom models, in executing privacy compliance checks and technical privacy reviews. Our experiments benchmark the models across multiple dimensions, focusing on their precision, recall, and F1-scores in extracting privacy-sensitive information and detecting key regulatory compliance points. While LLMs show promise in automating privacy reviews and identifying regulatory discrepancies, significant gaps persist in their ability to fully comply with evolving legal standards. We provide actionable recommendations for enhancing LLMs' capabilities in privacy compliance, emphasizing the need for robust model improvements and better integration with legal and regulatory requirements. This study underscores the growing importance of developing privacy-aware LLMs that can both support businesses in compliance efforts and safeguard user privacy rights.
