> Large Language Models for Anomaly and Out-of-Distribution Detection: A Survey

# 摘要

> 确保机器学习系统的可靠性和可信度，关键在于检测异常或分布外样本。大型语言模型（LLM）因其卓越的理解与生成能力，不仅在自然语言处理领域大放异彩，更在多领域应用中展现出其价值。LLM 融入异常与 OOD 检测，正引领该领域从传统模式向新范式转变。本调查深入探讨 LLM 背景下的异常与 OOD 检测问题，并提出一种新分类法，将现有方法依 LLM 角色细分为三类。我们详述各分类下的研究进展，并展望未来研究方向与挑战。此外，我们还整理了一份最新的相关论文清单，供读者参考。

> Detecting anomalies or out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is critical for maintaining the reliability and trustworthiness of machine learning systems. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness not only in natural language processing but also in broader applications due to their advanced comprehension and generative capabilities. The integration of LLMs into anomaly and OOD detection marks a significant shift from the traditional paradigm in the field. This survey focuses on the problem of anomaly and OOD detection under the context of LLMs. We propose a new taxonomy to categorize existing approaches into three classes based on the role played by LLMs. Following our proposed taxonomy, we further discuss the related work under each of the categories and finally discuss potential challenges and directions for future research in this field. We also provide an up-to-date reading list of relevant papers.
