> Empirical evidence of Large Language Model's influence on human spoken communication

# 摘要

> 得益于ChatGPT等大型语言模型的进步，AI现在能以自然语言与数十亿人互动。这让我们思考：AI是否正在改变我们的语言习惯？最新研究发现，科学文献中已出现AI特有的语言模式，但这些模式可能只是AI辅助编辑的结果。为了深入探究，我们分析了20,000多个学术频道上的280,000个英语视频。结果显示，ChatGPT发布后，与其相关的词汇使用明显增多。这首次证实了人类在口语中模仿AI的趋势。这一现象引发了对AI可能无意中减少语言多样性或被滥用进行大规模操纵的担忧，并强调了研究机器与人类文化互动的紧迫性。

> Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents now interact with billions of humans in natural language, thanks to advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. This raises the question of whether AI has the potential to shape a fundamental aspect of human culture: the way we speak. Recent analyses revealed that scientific publications already exhibit evidence of AI-specific language. But this evidence is inconclusive, since scientists may simply be using AI to copy-edit their writing. To explore whether AI has influenced human spoken communication, we transcribed and analyzed about 280,000 English-language videos of presentations, talks, and speeches from more than 20,000 YouTube channels of academic institutions. We find a significant shift in the trend of word usage specific to words distinctively associated with ChatGPT following its release. These findings provide the first empirical evidence that humans increasingly imitate LLMs in their spoken language. Our results raise societal and policy-relevant concerns about the potential of AI to unintentionally reduce linguistic diversity, or to be deliberately misused for mass manipulation. They also highlight the need for further investigation into the feedback loops between machine behavior and human culture.
