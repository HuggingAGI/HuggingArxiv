# 摘要

> 无论是策划假期、规划自动驾驶路线还是制定企业战略，有效的规划都是成功的关键。LLM因其卓越的常识推理能力，在自动化规划方面表现出色，能够从当前状态推断出实现目标的最佳行动序列。但遗憾的是，直接生成的计划往往在执行时遭遇失败。我们的研究深入探讨了语言模型在规划中的挑战，聚焦于具身环境、最优调度、游戏策略、任务分解、推理与规划等核心领域。通过这一探索，我们揭示了LLM如何革新AI规划，并展望了LM辅助规划的未来前景。

> Effective planning is essential for the success of any task, from organizing a vacation to routing autonomous vehicles and developing corporate strategies. It involves setting goals, formulating plans, and allocating resources to achieve them. LLMs are particularly well-suited for automated planning due to their strong capabilities in commonsense reasoning. They can deduce a sequence of actions needed to achieve a goal from a given state and identify an effective course of action. However, it is frequently observed that plans generated through direct prompting often fail upon execution. Our survey aims to highlight the existing challenges in planning with language models, focusing on key areas such as embodied environments, optimal scheduling, competitive and cooperative games, task decomposition, reasoning, and planning. Through this study, we explore how LLMs transform AI planning and provide unique insights into the future of LM-assisted planning.
