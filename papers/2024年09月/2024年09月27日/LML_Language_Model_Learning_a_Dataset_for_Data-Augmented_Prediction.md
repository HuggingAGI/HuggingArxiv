# 摘要

> 本文提出了一种利用大型语言模型 (LLM) 进行分类任务的新方法，该方法不同于传统依赖数据清理和特征工程的机器学习 (ML) 模型。我们引入了“语言模型学习 (LML)”概念，并采用“数据增强预测 (DAP)”技术，使 LLM 能够像人类一样探索和理解数据，从而进行分类。通过总结和评估训练数据，系统自动生成查询，检索相关数据行，确保分类的准确性。DAP 方法确保了上下文感知的决策，并在提示中加入“充当可解释的机器学习模型”，提升预测的可解释性。测试结果显示，该系统在某些情况下准确率超过 90%，显示出超越传统 ML 模型的潜力。代码已公开，详见 https://github.com/Pro-GenAI/LML-DAP。

> This paper introduces a new approach to using Large Language Models (LLMs) for classification tasks, which are typically handled using Machine Learning (ML) models. Unlike ML models that rely heavily on data cleaning and feature engineering, this method streamlines the process using LLMs. This paper proposes a new concept called "Language Model Learning (LML)" powered by a new method called "Data-Augmented Prediction (DAP)". The classification is performed by LLMs using a method similar to humans manually exploring and understanding the data and deciding classifications using data as a reference. Training data is summarized and evaluated to determine the features that lead to the classification of each label the most. In the process of DAP, the system uses the data summary to automatically create a query, which is used to retrieve relevant rows from the dataset. A classification is generated by the LLM using data summary and relevant rows, ensuring satisfactory accuracy even with complex data. Usage of data summary and similar data in DAP ensures context-aware decision-making. The proposed method uses the words "Act as an Explainable Machine Learning Model" in the prompt to enhance the interpretability of the predictions by allowing users to review the logic behind each prediction. In some test cases, the system scored an accuracy above 90%, proving the effectiveness of the system and its potential to outperform conventional ML models in various scenarios.
