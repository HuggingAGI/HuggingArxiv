# 摘要

> 随着各领域非结构化数据的激增，多文档理解和摘要变得至关重要。传统方法常在捕捉上下文、保持逻辑一致性和提取关键信息方面表现不佳。本文探索了长上下文大型语言模型 (LLM) 在多文档摘要中的应用，展示了其在把握复杂联系、生成连贯摘要及适应多行业和企业系统方面的卓越能力。通过法律、人力资源、财务、医疗和新闻等领域的案例研究，本文展示了长上下文 LLM 在效率和准确性上的显著提升。同时，本文深入分析了数据多样性、模型扩展性及伦理问题等技术挑战。最后，本文提出了未来研究方向，旨在强化长上下文 LLM 的功能和应用，使其成为跨行业和企业信息处理的核心工具。

> The rapid increase in unstructured data across various fields has made multi-document comprehension and summarization a critical task. Traditional approaches often fail to capture relevant context, maintain logical consistency, and extract essential information from lengthy documents. This paper explores the use of Long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-document summarization, demonstrating their exceptional capacity to grasp extensive connections, provide cohesive summaries, and adapt to various industry domains and integration with enterprise applications/systems. The paper discusses the workflow of multi-document summarization for effectively deploying long-context LLMs, supported by case studies in legal applications, enterprise functions such as HR, finance, and sourcing, as well as in the medical and news domains. These case studies show notable enhancements in both efficiency and accuracy. Technical obstacles, such as dataset diversity, model scalability, and ethical considerations like bias mitigation and factual accuracy, are carefully analyzed. Prospective research avenues are suggested to augment the functionalities and applications of long-context LLMs, establishing them as pivotal tools for transforming information processing across diverse sectors and enterprise applications.
