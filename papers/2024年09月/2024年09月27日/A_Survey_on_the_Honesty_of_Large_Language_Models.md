> A Survey on the Honesty of Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 诚实是 LLM 与人类价值观保持一致的核心，要求模型既能识别知识边界，又能忠实表达。然而，当前 LLM 仍常表现出不诚实行为，如自信地给出错误答案或隐瞒已知信息。研究 LLM 的诚实性也面临挑战，包括定义多样、知识边界难以界定等问题。为此，我们深入探讨了 LLM 的诚实性，涵盖定义、评估方法及改进策略，并展望未来研究方向，以期推动这一重要领域的发展。

> Honesty is a fundamental principle for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, requiring these models to recognize what they know and don't know and be able to faithfully express their knowledge. Despite promising, current LLMs still exhibit significant dishonest behaviors, such as confidently presenting wrong answers or failing to express what they know. In addition, research on the honesty of LLMs also faces challenges, including varying definitions of honesty, difficulties in distinguishing between known and unknown knowledge, and a lack of comprehensive understanding of related research. To address these issues, we provide a survey on the honesty of LLMs, covering its clarification, evaluation approaches, and strategies for improvement. Moreover, we offer insights for future research, aiming to inspire further exploration in this important area.
