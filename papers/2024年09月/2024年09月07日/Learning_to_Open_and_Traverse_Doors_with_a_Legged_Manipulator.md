> 摘要：机器人开门一直是个难题，但在让人类空间更易进入方面意义重大。这项任务因需在线适应不同门属性及精确操控门板和通过狭窄门口而具挑战。为此，我们设计了一种基于学习的腿式操纵器控制器。该控制器通过模拟中的教师-学生方法训练，学习稳健任务行为并估算交互中的关键门属性。与以往不同，我们的单一策略能处理推拉门，部署时推断开门方向，无需先验知识。在ANYmal机器人上测试，成功率达95.0%。更多实验证明其对各种门和干扰的有效性和鲁棒性。方法和实验视频概览见：http URL。

Abstract:Using doors is a longstanding challenge in robotics and is of significant practical interest in giving robots greater access to human-centric spaces. The task is challenging due to the need for online adaptation to varying door properties and precise control in manipulating the door panel and navigating through the confined doorway. To address this, we propose a learning-based controller for a legged manipulator to open and traverse through doors. The controller is trained using a teacher-student approach in simulation to learn robust task behaviors as well as estimate crucial door properties during the interaction. Unlike previous works, our approach is a single control policy that can handle both push and pull doors through learned behaviour which infers the opening direction during deployment without prior knowledge. The policy was deployed on the ANYmal legged robot with an arm and achieved a success rate of 95.0% in repeated trials conducted in an experimental setting. Additional experiments validate the policy's effectiveness and robustness to various doors and disturbances. A video overview of the method and experiments can be found at this http URL.
