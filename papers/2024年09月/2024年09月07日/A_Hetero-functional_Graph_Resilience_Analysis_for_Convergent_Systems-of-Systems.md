> A Hetero-functional Graph Resilience Analysis for Convergent Systems-of-Systems

# 摘要

> 现代生活离不开众多复杂的大型工程系统。面对潜在的破坏，这些系统能否持续运行并恢复常态？这一问题已成为多学科共同关注的焦点。本文提出了一种基于异功能图理论的韧性分析方法，并应用于系统间系统。通过系统建模语言和基于模型的系统工程，本文克服了多学科融合的挑战，兼顾了结构测量与行为模拟，推广了先前的韧性度量，并展示了其在能源-水纽带系统中的应用。

> Our modern life has grown to depend on many and nearly ubiquitous large complex engineering systems. Many disciplines now seemingly ask the same question: ``In the face of assumed disruption, to what degree will these systems continue to perform and when will they be able to bounce back to normal operation"? Furthermore, there is a growing recognition that the greatest societal challenges of the Anthropocene era are intertwined, necessitating a convergent systems-of-systems modeling and analysis framework based upon reconciled ontologies, data, and theoretical methods. Consequently, this paper develops a methodology for hetero-functional graph resilience analysis and demonstrates it on a convergent system-of-systems. It uses the Systems Modeling Language, model-based systems engineering and Hetero-Functional Graph Theory (HFGT) to overcome the convergence research challenges when constructing models and measures from multiple disciplines for systems resilience. The paper includes both the ``survival" as well as ``recovery" components of resilience. It also strikes a middle ground between two disparate approaches to resilience measurement: structural measurement of formal graphs and detailed behavioral simulation. This paper also generalizes a previous resilience measure based on HFGT and benefits from recent theoretical and computational developments in HFGT. To demonstrate the methodological developments, the resilience analysis is conducted on a hypothetical energy-water nexus system of moderate size as a type of system-of-systems.
