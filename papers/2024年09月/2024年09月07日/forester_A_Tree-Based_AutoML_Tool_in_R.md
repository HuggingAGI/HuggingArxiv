> forester: A Tree-Based AutoML Tool in R

# 摘要

> 虽然大多数 AutoML 解决方案基于 Python，但许多数据科学家使用 R 语言。然而，R 的 AutoML 工具稀缺且门槛高。为此，我们推出了 forester 包，一个易用的开源 R 工具，专为表格数据的高质量树模型训练设计。它支持分类、回归和部分生存分析，用户只需几步即可完成数据质量检测、预处理、模型训练与评估，并生成分析报告。

> The majority of automated machine learning (AutoML) solutions are developed in Python, however a large percentage of data scientists are associated with the R language. Unfortunately, there are limited R solutions available. Moreover high entry level means they are not accessible to everyone, due to required knowledge about machine learning (ML). To fill this gap, we present the forester package, which offers ease of use regardless of the user's proficiency in the area of machine learning.
  The forester is an open-source AutoML package implemented in R designed for training high-quality tree-based models on tabular data. It fully supports binary and multiclass classification, regression, and partially survival analysis tasks. With just a few functions, the user is capable of detecting issues regarding the data quality, preparing the preprocessing pipeline, training and tuning tree-based models, evaluating the results, and creating the report for further analysis.
