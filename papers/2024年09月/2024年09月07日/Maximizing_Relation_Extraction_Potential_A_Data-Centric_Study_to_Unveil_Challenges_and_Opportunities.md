> Maximizing Relation Extraction Potential: A Data-Centric Study to Unveil Challenges and Opportunities

# 摘要

> 关系抽取，作为信息抽取的核心环节，旨在从文本中提炼出有价值的关系。尽管现代神经网络在计算上表现出色，但在处理复杂抽取场景时仍显不足。本文填补了文献中对最先进关系抽取器性能分析的空白，深入探讨了阻碍神经关系抽取的数据特征，如上下文模糊、长尾数据等。通过15种前沿算法和七大数据集的实验，我们发现现有抽取器在应对复杂数据时表现欠佳。文章不仅指出了问题，更为未来研究指明了方向，成为信息抽取领域，尤其是搜索引擎和聊天机器人等应用中不可或缺的参考。相关资源已公开在https://github.com/anushkasw/MaxRE。

> Relation extraction is a Natural Language Processing task aiming to extract relationships from textual data. It is a critical step for information extraction. Due to its wide-scale applicability, research in relation extraction has rapidly scaled to using highly advanced neural networks. Despite their computational superiority, modern relation extractors fail to handle complicated extraction scenarios. However, a comprehensive performance analysis of the state-of-the-art relation extractors that compile these challenges has been missing from the literature, and this paper aims to bridge this gap. The goal has been to investigate the possible data-centric characteristics that impede neural relation extraction. Based on extensive experiments conducted using 15 state-of-the-art relation extraction algorithms ranging from recurrent architectures to large language models and seven large-scale datasets, this research suggests that modern relation extractors are not robust to complex data and relation characteristics. It emphasizes pivotal issues, such as contextual ambiguity, correlating relations, long-tail data, and fine-grained relation distributions. In addition, it sets a marker for future directions to alleviate these issues, thereby proving to be a critical resource for novice and advanced researchers. Efficient handling of the challenges described can have significant implications for the field of information extraction, which is a critical part of popular systems such as search engines and chatbots.
