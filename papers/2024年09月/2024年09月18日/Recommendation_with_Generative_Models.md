# 摘要

> 生成模型通过学习数据分布并从中采样，能够创造全新的数据实例。近年来，随着 GANs、VAEs 和基于 Transformer 的模型（如 GPT）的兴起，生成模型在机器学习领域备受瞩目。它们广泛应用于图像生成、文本合成和音乐创作等领域。在推荐系统中，生成模型（Gen-RecSys）通过生成结构化输出和多媒体内容，提升了推荐的准确性和多样性。这不仅使推荐更加个性化和动态，还拓展了 AI 在电子商务和媒体等领域的应用。我们的书籍深入探讨了生成模型的理论与实践，特别关注深度生成模型（DGMs）及其分类。我们提出了一种分类法，将 DGMs 分为 ID 驱动模型、大型语言模型（LLMs）和多模态模型，每类模型在其研究领域内都有独特的技术进步。这有助于研究人员更好地理解 Gen-RecSys 在对话 AI 和多模态内容生成等领域的最新进展。此外，我们还探讨了生成模型的潜在风险，强调了建立强大评估框架的重要性。

> Generative models are a class of AI models capable of creating new instances of data by learning and sampling from their statistical distributions. In recent years, these models have gained prominence in machine learning due to the development of approaches such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), and transformer-based architectures such as GPT. These models have applications across various domains, such as image generation, text synthesis, and music composition. In recommender systems, generative models, referred to as Gen-RecSys, improve the accuracy and diversity of recommendations by generating structured outputs, text-based interactions, and multimedia content. By leveraging these capabilities, Gen-RecSys can produce more personalized, engaging, and dynamic user experiences, expanding the role of AI in eCommerce, media, and beyond.
  Our book goes beyond existing literature by offering a comprehensive understanding of generative models and their applications, with a special focus on deep generative models (DGMs) and their classification. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes DGMs into three types: ID-driven models, large language models (LLMs), and multimodal models. Each category addresses unique technical and architectural advancements within its respective research area. This taxonomy allows researchers to easily navigate developments in Gen-RecSys across domains such as conversational AI and multimodal content generation. Additionally, we examine the impact and potential risks of generative models, emphasizing the importance of robust evaluation frameworks.
