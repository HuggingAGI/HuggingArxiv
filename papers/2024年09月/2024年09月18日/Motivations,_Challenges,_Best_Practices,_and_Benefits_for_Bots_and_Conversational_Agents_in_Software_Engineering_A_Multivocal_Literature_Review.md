> Motivations, Challenges, Best Practices, and Benefits for Bots and Conversational Agents in Software Engineering: A Multivocal Literature Review

# 摘要

> 机器人是自动化用户任务的软件系统，当它们具备对话功能时，也被称为对话代理。随着人工智能技术的发展，特别是生成式AI和大语言模型的出现，机器人在软件开发中的应用日益广泛。然而，尽管潜力巨大，机器人仍需改进，以更好地融入开发流程，因为它们带来的挑战可能多于益处。为此，我们提出了一套机器人分类法，并探讨了其在软件工程中应用的挑战及应对策略。通过多声部文献综述，我们不仅为未来研究指明了方向，还为从业者提供了实用的改进建议，并促进了研究成果向实践的转化。

> Bots are software systems designed to support users by automating a specific process, task, or activity. When such systems implement a conversational component to interact with the users, they are also known as conversational agents. Bots, particularly in their conversation-oriented version and AI-powered, have seen their adoption increase over time for software development and engineering purposes. Despite their exciting potential, ulteriorly enhanced by the advent of Generative AI and Large Language Models, bots still need to be improved to develop and integrate into the development cycle since practitioners report that bots add additional challenges that may worsen rather than improve. In this work, we aim to provide a taxonomy for characterizing bots, as well as a series of challenges for their adoption for Software Engineering associated with potential mitigation strategies. To reach our objectives, we conducted a multivocal literature review, reviewing both research and practitioner's literature. Through such an approach, we hope to contribute to both researchers and practitioners by providing first, a series of future research routes to follow, second, a list of strategies to adopt for improving the use of bots for software engineering purposes, and third, enforce a technology and knowledge transfer from the research field to the practitioners one, that is one of the primary goal of multivocal literature reviews.
