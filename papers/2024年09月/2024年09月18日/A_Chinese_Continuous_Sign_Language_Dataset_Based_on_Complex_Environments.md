# 摘要

> 当前 CSLR 研究面临的主要问题是，现有数据集多局限于实验室或电视节目，背景单一、光照均匀，与真实生活场景的多样性和复杂性相去甚远。为此，我们创建了名为 CE-CSL 的大规模中文手语数据集，涵盖 5,988 个日常场景视频，背景多样，确保了数据集的代表性和泛化能力。为应对复杂背景带来的挑战，我们设计了 TFNet 模型，通过提取帧级特征并结合时间和频谱信息，实现高效准确的 CSLR。实验证明，我们的方法在 CE-CSL 上表现优异，且在其他三个公开数据集上也取得了出色成绩。

> The current bottleneck in continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) research lies in the fact that most publicly available datasets are limited to laboratory environments or television program recordings, resulting in a single background environment with uniform lighting, which significantly deviates from the diversity and complexity found in real-life scenarios. To address this challenge, we have constructed a new, large-scale dataset for Chinese continuous sign language (CSL) based on complex environments, termed the complex environment - chinese sign language dataset (CE-CSL). This dataset encompasses 5,988 continuous CSL video clips collected from daily life scenes, featuring more than 70 different complex backgrounds to ensure representativeness and generalization capability. To tackle the impact of complex backgrounds on CSLR performance, we propose a time-frequency network (TFNet) model for continuous sign language recognition. This model extracts frame-level features and then utilizes both temporal and spectral information to separately derive sequence features before fusion, aiming to achieve efficient and accurate CSLR. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant performance improvements on the CE-CSL, validating its effectiveness under complex background conditions. Additionally, our proposed method has also yielded highly competitive results when applied to three publicly available CSL datasets.
