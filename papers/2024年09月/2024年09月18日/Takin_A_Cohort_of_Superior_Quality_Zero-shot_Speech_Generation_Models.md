> Takin: A Cohort of Superior Quality Zero-shot Speech Generation Models

# 摘要

> 随着大数据和大型语言模型的兴起，零-shot个性化定制成为新趋势。本报告介绍Takin AudioLLM系列技术，包括Takin TTS、Takin VC和Takin Morphing，专为有声书制作设计。这些模型能零-shot生成逼真语音，满足个性化需求。Takin TTS基于增强神经编解码器和多任务框架，生成高保真语音。Takin VC通过内容和音色联合建模提升说话者相似度，并采用条件流匹配解码器增强自然性。Takin Morphing系统则提供高度解耦的音色和韵律建模，实现精准可控的语音定制。实验证明其有效性和鲁棒性。详细演示请访问https://takinaudiollm.github.io。

> With the advent of the big data and large language model era, zero-shot personalized rapid customization has emerged as a significant trend. In this report, we introduce Takin AudioLLM, a series of techniques and models, mainly including Takin TTS, Takin VC, and Takin Morphing, specifically designed for audiobook production. These models are capable of zero-shot speech production, generating high-quality speech that is nearly indistinguishable from real human speech and facilitating individuals to customize the speech content according to their own needs. Specifically, we first introduce Takin TTS, a neural codec language model that builds upon an enhanced neural speech codec and a multi-task training framework, capable of generating high-fidelity natural speech in a zero-shot way. For Takin VC, we advocate an effective content and timbre joint modeling approach to improve the speaker similarity, while advocating for a conditional flow matching based decoder to further enhance its naturalness and expressiveness. Last, we propose the Takin Morphing system with highly decoupled and advanced timbre and prosody modeling approaches, which enables individuals to customize speech production with their preferred timbre and prosody in a precise and controllable manner. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of our Takin AudioLLM series models. For detailed demos, please refer to https://takinaudiollm.github.io.
