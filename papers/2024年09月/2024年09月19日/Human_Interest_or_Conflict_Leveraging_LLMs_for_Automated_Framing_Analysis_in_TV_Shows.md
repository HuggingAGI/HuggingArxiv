> Human Interest or Conflict? Leveraging LLMs for Automated Framing Analysis in TV Shows

# 摘要

> 在当今媒体环境中，理解信息框架对于批判性消费和明智决策至关重要。框架分析是识别信息呈现背后视角的有效工具，已广泛应用于电视节目等多种媒体形式。然而，手动分析框架既耗时又费力。此时，大型语言模型（LLM）便能大显身手。本文提出了一种创新方法，利用提示工程识别电视节目中口语内容的框架。研究显示，提示工程LLM可作为识别框架的辅助工具，人机一致率高达43%。鉴于LLM仍在发展，我们相信该方法仍有提升空间。此技术在互动媒体领域的应用潜力巨大，涵盖记者辅助工具、新闻学子教育资源及观众互动体验等多方面。

> In the current media landscape, understanding the framing of information is crucial for critical consumption and informed decision making. Framing analysis is a valuable tool for identifying the underlying perspectives used to present information, and has been applied to a variety of media formats, including television programs. However, manual analysis of framing can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. This is where large language models (LLMs) can play a key role. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to use prompt-engineering to identify the framing of spoken content in television programs. Our findings indicate that prompt-engineering LLMs can be used as a support tool to identify frames, with agreement rates between human and machine reaching up to 43\%. As LLMs are still under development, we believe that our approach has the potential to be refined and further improved. The potential of this technology for interactive media applications is vast, including the development of support tools for journalists, educational resources for students of journalism learning about framing and related concepts, and interactive media experiences for audiences.
