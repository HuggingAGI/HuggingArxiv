# 摘要

> 食品工业的风味开发面临快速创新和精确风味轮廓创建的挑战。传统方法依赖于迭代、主观测试，效率和可扩展性不足。本文提出三项创新：首先，定义了风味科学中的新问题领域，即假设生成；其次，引入FoodPuzzle基准，包含978种食品和1,766种风味分子；最后，提出结合上下文学习和检索增强技术的科学代理方法。实验显示，该模型在风味预测中显著优于传统方法，有望革新风味开发实践。

> Flavor development in the food industry is increasingly challenged by the need for rapid innovation and precise flavor profile creation. Traditional flavor research methods typically rely on iterative, subjective testing, which lacks the efficiency and scalability required for modern demands. This paper presents three contributions to address the challenges. Firstly, we define a new problem domain for scientific agents in flavor science, conceptualized as the generation of hypotheses for flavor profile sourcing and understanding. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce the FoodPuzzle, a challenging benchmark consisting of 978 food items and 1,766 flavor molecules profiles. We propose a novel Scientific Agent approach, integrating in-context learning and retrieval augmented techniques to generate grounded hypotheses in the domain of food science. Experimental results indicate that our model significantly surpasses traditional methods in flavor profile prediction tasks, demonstrating its potential to transform flavor development practices.
