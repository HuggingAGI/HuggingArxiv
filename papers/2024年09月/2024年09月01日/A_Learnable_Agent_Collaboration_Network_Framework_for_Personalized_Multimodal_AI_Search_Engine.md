# 摘要

> 大型语言模型与检索增强生成技术，正革新传统信息获取方式，使AI代理能在动态对话中为用户搜寻并总结信息。然而，现有AI搜索引擎在多模态信息支持、个性化响应、复杂问题逻辑解答及交互灵活性等方面，仍有显著提升空间。为此，我们提出代理协作网络（ACN）框架，该框架通过多个专业代理协同作业，涵盖账户管理、策略制定、信息处理及内容创作等角色，集成图像理解、用户追踪与在线进化机制，显著提升搜索响应质量、个性化与交互性。特别地，ACN引入反射前向优化方法，支持代理间实时协同调整，赋予系统在线学习能力，确保其交互灵活性并快速响应用户反馈，此学习机制亦可作为代理系统优化新途径，有望拓展至其他代理应用领域。

> Large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques have revolutionized traditional information access, enabling AI agent to search and summarize information on behalf of users during dynamic dialogues. Despite their potential, current AI search engines exhibit considerable room for improvement in several critical areas. These areas include the support for multimodal information, the delivery of personalized responses, the capability to logically answer complex questions, and the facilitation of more flexible interactions. This paper proposes a novel AI Search Engine framework called the Agent Collaboration Network (ACN). The ACN framework consists of multiple specialized agents working collaboratively, each with distinct roles such as Account Manager, Solution Strategist, Information Manager, and Content Creator. This framework integrates mechanisms for picture content understanding, user profile tracking, and online evolution, enhancing the AI search engine's response quality, personalization, and interactivity. A highlight of the ACN is the introduction of a Reflective Forward Optimization method (RFO), which supports the online synergistic adjustment among agents. This feature endows the ACN with online learning capabilities, ensuring that the system has strong interactive flexibility and can promptly adapt to user feedback. This learning method may also serve as an optimization approach for agent-based systems, potentially influencing other domains of agent applications.
