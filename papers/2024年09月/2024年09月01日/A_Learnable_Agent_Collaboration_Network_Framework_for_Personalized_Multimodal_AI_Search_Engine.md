# 摘要

> 大型语言模型与检索增强生成技术，正引领信息访问的革新，使AI代理能在动态对话中为用户搜寻并总结信息。然而，现有AI搜索引擎在多模态信息支持、个性化响应、复杂问题逻辑解答及交互灵活性等方面，仍有提升空间。本文提出的代理协作网络框架，通过多角色代理的协同工作，如账户经理、策略师、信息管理员和内容创作者，结合图片理解、用户跟踪与在线演化机制，显著提升了搜索引擎的响应质量、个性化与交互性。特别地，反射前向优化方法的引入，使代理间能在线协同调整，赋予系统在线学习能力，确保其交互灵活性并快速适应用户反馈，为基于代理的系统优化开辟新径，可能对其他代理应用领域产生深远影响。

> Large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques have revolutionized traditional information access, enabling AI agent to search and summarize information on behalf of users during dynamic dialogues. Despite their potential, current AI search engines exhibit considerable room for improvement in several critical areas. These areas include the support for multimodal information, the delivery of personalized responses, the capability to logically answer complex questions, and the facilitation of more flexible interactions. This paper proposes a novel AI Search Engine framework called the Agent Collaboration Network (ACN). The ACN framework consists of multiple specialized agents working collaboratively, each with distinct roles such as Account Manager, Solution Strategist, Information Manager, and Content Creator. This framework integrates mechanisms for picture content understanding, user profile tracking, and online evolution, enhancing the AI search engine's response quality, personalization, and interactivity. A highlight of the ACN is the introduction of a Reflective Forward Optimization method (RFO), which supports the online synergistic adjustment among agents. This feature endows the ACN with online learning capabilities, ensuring that the system has strong interactive flexibility and can promptly adapt to user feedback. This learning method may also serve as an optimization approach for agent-based systems, potentially influencing other domains of agent applications.
