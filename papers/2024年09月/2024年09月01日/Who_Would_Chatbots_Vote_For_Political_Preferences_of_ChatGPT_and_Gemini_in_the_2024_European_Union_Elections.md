> Who Would Chatbots Vote For? Political Preferences of ChatGPT and Gemini in the 2024 European Union Elections

# 摘要

> 本研究深入探讨了ChatGPT和Gemini在2024年欧洲议会选举中的政治偏见。通过每日标准化提示收集数据，研究发现Gemini常回避政治问题，而ChatGPT则持续给出评分。ChatGPT明显偏袒左翼和中立党派，尤其是绿党/欧洲自由联盟，而对右翼党派评分较低。研究揭示了影响评分的因素，如对欧洲一体化的态度和民主价值观的认知。这些发现强调了在政治环境中对AI生成信息保持批判性的重要性，并呼吁加强透明度和监管。

> This study examines the political bias of chatbots powered by large language models, namely ChatGPT and Gemini, in the context of the 2024 European Parliament elections. The research focused on the evaluation of political parties represented in the European Parliament across 27 EU Member States by these generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The methodology involved daily data collection through standardized prompts on both platforms. The results revealed a stark contrast: while Gemini mostly refused to answer political questions, ChatGPT provided consistent ratings. The analysis showed a significant bias in ChatGPT in favor of left-wing and centrist parties, with the highest ratings for the Greens/European Free Alliance. In contrast, right-wing parties, particularly the Identity and Democracy group, received the lowest ratings. The study identified key factors influencing the ratings, including attitudes toward European integration and perceptions of democratic values. The findings highlight the need for a critical approach to information provided by generative AI systems in a political context and call for more transparency and regulation in this area.
