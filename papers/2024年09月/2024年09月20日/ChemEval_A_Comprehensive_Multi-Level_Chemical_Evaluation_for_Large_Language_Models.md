> ChemEval: A Comprehensive Multi-Level Chemical Evaluation for Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 化学领域中 LLMs 的角色日益受到关注，推动了专门针对化学任务的 LLMs 基准开发。然而，现有基准未能充分满足化学研究者的需求。为此，我们推出了 \textbf{\textit{ChemEval}}，全面评估 LLMs 在化学任务中的能力。ChemEval 涵盖 42 个化学任务，基于开源数据和专家精心设计的数据，确保任务的实际价值和评估的有效性。实验中，我们在零-shot 和 few-shot 学习环境下测试了 12 个主流 LLMs，发现通用 LLMs 如 GPT-4 和 Claude-3.5 在文献理解和指令跟随上表现优异，但在需要高级化学知识的任务中表现不佳。而专门的 LLMs 则在化学能力上有所增强，尽管文学理解能力有所下降。这表明 LLMs 在处理复杂化学任务时仍有巨大潜力。我们的工作旨在推动这一潜力，促进化学领域的进步。基准和分析详情请访问 {\color{blue} \url{https://github.com/USTC-StarTeam/ChemEval}}。

> There is a growing interest in the role that LLMs play in chemistry which lead to an increased focus on the development of LLMs benchmarks tailored to chemical domains to assess the performance of LLMs across a spectrum of chemical tasks varying in type and complexity. However, existing benchmarks in this domain fail to adequately meet the specific requirements of chemical research professionals. To this end, we propose \textbf{\textit{ChemEval}}, which provides a comprehensive assessment of the capabilities of LLMs across a wide range of chemical domain tasks. Specifically, ChemEval identified 4 crucial progressive levels in chemistry, assessing 12 dimensions of LLMs across 42 distinct chemical tasks which are informed by open-source data and the data meticulously crafted by chemical experts, ensuring that the tasks have practical value and can effectively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs. In the experiment, we evaluate 12 mainstream LLMs on ChemEval under zero-shot and few-shot learning contexts, which included carefully selected demonstration examples and carefully designed prompts. The results show that while general LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude-3.5 excel in literature understanding and instruction following, they fall short in tasks demanding advanced chemical knowledge. Conversely, specialized LLMs exhibit enhanced chemical competencies, albeit with reduced literary comprehension. This suggests that LLMs have significant potential for enhancement when tackling sophisticated tasks in the field of chemistry. We believe our work will facilitate the exploration of their potential to drive progress in chemistry.
