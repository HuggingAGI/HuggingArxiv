# 摘要

> 近年来，电商行业对 AI 驱动的客户服务需求激增。然而，传统云模型在延迟、个性化和隐私方面存在局限，且终端设备计算资源有限。为此，我们提出创新的端云协作 (ECC) 框架，整合云与终端模型的优势，缓解计算压力。云模型作为导师，指导终端模型学习，减少其对大数据的依赖，突破传统训练瓶颈，加速行业应用部署。我们还引入在线进化学习策略，使终端模型能根据云指导和用户反馈持续升级，灵活适应变化，同时保护隐私。最终，我们通过深入数据处理，训练出适用于电商客服的 ECC 模型。

> In recent years, the e-commerce industry has seen a rapid increase in the demand for advanced AI-driven customer service solutions. Traditional cloud-based models face limitations in terms of latency, personalized services, and privacy concerns. Furthermore, end devices often lack the computational resources to deploy large AI models effectively. In this paper, we propose an innovative End-Cloud Collaboration (ECC) framework for advanced AI customer service in e-commerce. This framework integrates the advantages of large cloud models and mid/small-sized end models by deeply exploring the generalization potential of cloud models and effectively utilizing the computing power resources of terminal chips, alleviating the strain on computing resources to some extent. Specifically, the large cloud model acts as a teacher, guiding and promoting the learning of the end model, which significantly reduces the end model's reliance on large-scale, high-quality data and thereby addresses the data bottleneck in traditional end model training, offering a new paradigm for the rapid deployment of industry applications. Additionally, we introduce an online evolutive learning strategy that enables the end model to continuously iterate and upgrade based on guidance from the cloud model and real-time user feedback. This strategy ensures that the model can flexibly adapt to the rapid changes in application scenarios while avoiding the uploading of sensitive information by performing local fine-tuning, achieving the dual goals of privacy protection and personalized service. %We make systematic contributions to the customized model fine-tuning methods in the e-commerce domain. To conclude, we implement in-depth corpus collection (e.g., data organization, cleaning, and preprocessing) and train an ECC-based industry-specific model for e-commerce customer service.
