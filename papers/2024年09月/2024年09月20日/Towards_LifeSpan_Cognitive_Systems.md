> 构建一个能够持续与复杂环境交互的人类化系统，面临着多个关键挑战。核心在于实现持续的高频交互，这些交互被称为经验。我们称之为生命周期认知系统（LSCS）。LSCS的关键在于它能在快速更新的同时，保留并准确回忆过去的经验。我们确定了两大挑战：抽象与经验融合，以及长期保留与准确回忆。这些特性对于存储新经验、组织旧经验以及利用历史数据对环境做出反应至关重要。与依赖大型语料库进行微调的持续学习语言模型不同，LSCS必须以高频率快速更新来自环境的新信息。现有技术根据存储复杂度分为四类，各有优劣。鉴于现有技术无法单独实现LSCS，我们提出了一种集成四类技术的新范式。新范式通过吸收经验和生成响应两个核心过程运作。

> Building a human-like system that continuously interacts with complex environments -- whether simulated digital worlds or human society -- presents several key challenges. Central to this is enabling continuous, high-frequency interactions, where the interactions are termed experiences. We refer to this envisioned system as the LifeSpan Cognitive System (LSCS). A critical feature of LSCS is its ability to engage in incremental and rapid updates while retaining and accurately recalling past experiences. We identify two major challenges in achieving this: (1) Abstraction and Experience Merging, and (2) Long-term Retention with Accurate Recall. These properties are essential for storing new experiences, organizing past experiences, and responding to the environment in ways that leverage relevant historical data. Unlike language models with continual learning, which typically rely on large corpora for fine-tuning and focus on improving performance within specific domains or tasks, LSCS must rapidly and incrementally update with new information from its environment at a high frequency. Existing technologies with the potential of solving the above two major challenges can be classified into four classes based on a conceptual metric called Storage Complexity, which measures the relative space required to store past experiences. Each of these four classes of technologies has its own strengths and limitations. Given that none of the existing technologies can achieve LSCS alone, we propose a novel paradigm for LSCS that integrates all four classes of technologies. The new paradigm operates through two core processes: Absorbing Experiences and Generating Responses.
