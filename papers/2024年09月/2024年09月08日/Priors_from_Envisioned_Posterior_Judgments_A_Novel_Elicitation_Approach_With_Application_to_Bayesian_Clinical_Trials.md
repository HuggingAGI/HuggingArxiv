> Priors from Envisioned Posterior Judgments: A Novel Elicitation Approach With Application to Bayesian Clinical Trials

# 摘要

> 贝叶斯临床试验中，从专家获取正式先验信息的做法受限于复杂统计建模、缺乏实用工具及专家量化不确定性的认知负担。现有方法未解决先验-后验一致性问题，即数学上结合先验与试验数据得出的后验分布是否反映专家实际信念。我们提出新方法，确保先验-后验一致性并减轻专家负担，通过启发专家对不同数据结果的后验判断，推断先验分布以最小化反应差异。通过应用于实际试验，展示了新方法的可行性与潜在价值。

> The uptake of formalized prior elicitation from experts in Bayesian clinical trials has been limited, largely due to the challenges associated with complex statistical modeling, the lack of practical tools, and the cognitive burden on experts required to quantify their uncertainty using probabilistic language. Additionally, existing methods do not address prior-posterior coherence, i.e., does the posterior distribution, obtained mathematically from combining the estimated prior with the trial data, reflect the expert's actual posterior beliefs? We propose a new elicitation approach that seeks to ensure prior-posterior coherence and reduce the expert's cognitive burden. This is achieved by eliciting responses about the expert's envisioned posterior judgments under various potential data outcomes and inferring the prior distribution by minimizing the discrepancies between these responses and the expected responses obtained from the posterior distribution. The feasibility and potential value of the new approach are illustrated through an application to a real trial currently underway.
