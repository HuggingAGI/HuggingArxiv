> Using Large Language Models for Template Detection from Security Event Logs

# 摘要

> 在现代IT系统中，实时与离线的事件日志分析是网络安全监控的核心。特别是，事件日志分析技术对于及时发现网络攻击和帮助安全专家分析过往事件至关重要。从非结构化文本日志中识别模式或模板，是事件日志分析的关键任务，因为这些模板代表了日志中的事件类型，为后续的在线或离线安全监控打下基础。尽管过去二十年提出了多种模板挖掘算法，但许多仍依赖传统数据挖掘技术，而大型语言模型（LLMs）的应用尚未得到充分关注。此外，多数利用LLMs的方法是有监督的，无监督的LLM模板挖掘仍是一个未被充分探索的领域。本文旨在填补这一研究空白，探讨LLMs在无监督情况下从非结构化安全事件日志中检测模板的应用。

> In modern IT systems and computer networks, real-time and offline event log analysis is a crucial part of cyber security monitoring. In particular, event log analysis techniques are essential for the timely detection of cyber attacks and for assisting security experts with the analysis of past security incidents. The detection of line patterns or templates from unstructured textual event logs has been identified as an important task of event log analysis since detected templates represent event types in the event log and prepare the logs for downstream online or offline security monitoring tasks. During the last two decades, a number of template mining algorithms have been proposed. However, many proposed algorithms rely on traditional data mining techniques, and the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) has received less attention so far. Also, most approaches that harness LLMs are supervised, and unsupervised LLM-based template mining remains an understudied area. The current paper addresses this research gap and investigates the application of LLMs for unsupervised detection of templates from unstructured security event logs.
