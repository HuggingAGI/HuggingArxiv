# 摘要

> 近年来，大型语言模型（LLM）在规模和能力上飞速发展，但其训练数据主要集中在英语。随着多语言LLM的兴起，越来越多的努力致力于让模型适应全球北方以外社区的语言，这些语言在数字领域长期被忽视。这些“低资源语言”或“长尾语言”在LLM中的表现普遍不佳。虽然扩展LLM的应用范围至更多语言可能带来诸多益处，如促进跨文化交流和语言保护，但必须谨慎行事，确保数据收集过程不具剥削性，避免重蹈历史覆辙。从被殖民者、原住民及非西方语言中收集数据，涉及复杂的政治和社会伦理问题，如同意、文化安全及数据主权等。此外，LLM往往难以捕捉语言的复杂性和文化细节。本文结合最新研究及我们的实践，探讨了相关社会、文化和伦理问题，并提出通过定性研究、社区合作及参与式设计等方法来应对。我们为收集全球北方以外代表性不足语言社区的数据提供了十二条建议。

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly increased in size and apparent capabilities in the last three years, but their training data is largely English text. There is growing interest in multilingual LLMs, and various efforts are striving for models to accommodate languages of communities outside of the Global North, which include many languages that have been historically underrepresented in digital realms. These languages have been coined as "low resource languages" or "long-tail languages", and LLMs performance on these languages is generally poor. While expanding the use of LLMs to more languages may bring many potential benefits, such as assisting cross-community communication and language preservation, great care must be taken to ensure that data collection on these languages is not extractive and that it does not reproduce exploitative practices of the past. Collecting data from languages spoken by previously colonized people, indigenous people, and non-Western languages raises many complex sociopolitical and ethical questions, e.g., around consent, cultural safety, and data sovereignty. Furthermore, linguistic complexity and cultural nuances are often lost in LLMs. This position paper builds on recent scholarship, and our own work, and outlines several relevant social, cultural, and ethical considerations and potential ways to mitigate them through qualitative research, community partnerships, and participatory design approaches. We provide twelve recommendations for consideration when collecting language data on underrepresented language communities outside of the Global North.
