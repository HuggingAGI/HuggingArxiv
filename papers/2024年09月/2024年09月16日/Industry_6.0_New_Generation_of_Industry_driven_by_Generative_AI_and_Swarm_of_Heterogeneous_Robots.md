> Industry 6.0: New Generation of Industry driven by Generative AI and Swarm of Heterogeneous Robots

# 摘要

> 本文提出了工业6.0的概念，展示了全球首个基于自然语言描述的全自动生产系统。借助生成式AI，该系统自主完成了从产品设计到制造的各个环节，包括蓝图设计、部件制造、物流和组装。通过与大型语言模型（LLM）的集成，一群异构机器人协同工作，涵盖了机械臂、无人机和3D打印机等多种设备。系统通过商业和开源LLM的API及本地部署进行了评估。用户研究显示，该系统将生产时间大幅缩短至119.10分钟，远超人类专家团队的528.64分钟（提升4.4倍）。在蓝图设计环节，系统更是以47倍的效率击败了人类CAD操作员，仅需0.5分钟，而人类需23.5分钟。这一创新标志着向全自主制造的重大飞跃。

> This paper presents the concept of Industry 6.0, introducing the world's first fully automated production system that autonomously handles the entire product design and manufacturing process based on user-provided natural language descriptions. By leveraging generative AI, the system automates critical aspects of production, including product blueprint design, component manufacturing, logistics, and assembly. A heterogeneous swarm of robots, each equipped with individual AI through integration with Large Language Models (LLMs), orchestrates the production process. The robotic system includes manipulator arms, delivery drones, and 3D printers capable of generating assembly blueprints. The system was evaluated using commercial and open-source LLMs, functioning through APIs and local deployment. A user study demonstrated that the system reduces the average production time to 119.10 minutes, significantly outperforming a team of expert human developers, who averaged 528.64 minutes (an improvement factor of 4.4). Furthermore, in the product blueprinting stage, the system surpassed human CAD operators by an unprecedented factor of 47, completing the task in 0.5 minutes compared to 23.5 minutes. This breakthrough represents a major leap towards fully autonomous manufacturing.
