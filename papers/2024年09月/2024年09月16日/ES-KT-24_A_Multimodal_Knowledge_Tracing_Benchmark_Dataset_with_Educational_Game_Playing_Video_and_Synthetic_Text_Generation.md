# 摘要

> 本文推出 ES-KT-24，一个专为教育游戏设计的智能辅导系统多模态知识追踪数据集。现有数据集常缺乏游戏元素，ES-KT-24 通过整合游戏视频、合成问答文本和详细日志，填补了这一空白。涵盖数学、英语、印尼语和马来语，包含非英语内容，合成文本涵盖 28 个知识概念和 182 个问题，涉及 15,032 名用户和 7,782,928 次互动。实验表明，LKT 模型略优于传统 DKT 模型，凸显语言模型方法的潜力。ES-KT-24 不仅推动多模态 KT 模型研究，还通过整合游戏视频和日志，提供独特视角，通过高级分析技术揭示学习模式，有望带来新见解，激发更多探索。

> This paper introduces ES-KT-24, a novel multimodal Knowledge Tracing (KT) dataset for intelligent tutoring systems in educational game contexts. Although KT is crucial in adaptive learning, existing datasets often lack game-based and multimodal elements. ES-KT-24 addresses these limitations by incorporating educational game-playing videos, synthetically generated question text, and detailed game logs. The dataset covers Mathematics, English, Indonesian, and Malaysian subjects, emphasizing diversity and including non-English content. The synthetic text component, generated using a large language model, encompasses 28 distinct knowledge concepts and 182 questions, featuring 15,032 users and 7,782,928 interactions. Our benchmark experiments demonstrate the dataset's utility for KT research by comparing Deep learning-based KT models with Language Model-based Knowledge Tracing (LKT) approaches. Notably, LKT models showed slightly higher performance than traditional DKT models, highlighting the potential of language model-based approaches in this field. Furthermore, ES-KT-24 has the potential to significantly advance research in multimodal KT models and learning analytics. By integrating game-playing videos and detailed game logs, this dataset offers a unique approach to dissecting student learning patterns through advanced data analysis and machine-learning techniques. It has the potential to unearth new insights into the learning process and inspire further exploration in the field.
