> Securing the Future: Exploring Privacy Risks and Security Questions in Robotic Systems

# 摘要

> 人工智能，尤其是大型语言模型与机器人的结合，正推动着该领域的飞速进步。如今，机器人已深入我们的日常生活，其发展速度之快令人惊叹。尽管这些进步极大地便利了我们的生活，但与之相关的安全和隐私问题仍未完全解决。因此，在享受机器人带来的便利的同时，确保其安全性和隐私性变得尤为重要。本文将探讨机器人当前的应用、潜在威胁、未来发展趋势及其可能引发的安全和隐私问题，并提出一系列值得深入研究的问题。

> The integration of artificial intelligence, especially large language models in robotics, has led to rapid advancements in the field. We are now observing an unprecedented surge in the use of robots in our daily lives. The development and continual improvements of robots are moving at an astonishing pace. Although these remarkable improvements facilitate and enhance our lives, several security and privacy concerns have not been resolved yet. Therefore, it has become crucial to address the privacy and security threats of robotic systems while improving our experiences. In this paper, we aim to present existing applications and threats of robotics, anticipated future evolution, and the security and privacy issues they may imply. We present a series of open questions for researchers and practitioners to explore further.
