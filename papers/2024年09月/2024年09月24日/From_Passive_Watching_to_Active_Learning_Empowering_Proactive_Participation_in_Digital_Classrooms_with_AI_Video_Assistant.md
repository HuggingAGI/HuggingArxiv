# 摘要

> 在线教育中，创新工具如SAM（与AI导师一起学习）至关重要。SAM结合教育视频与智能聊天界面，鼓励学生实时提问，提供个性化辅导。在一项140人参与的研究中，使用SAM的学生知识提升显著，答案准确率达96.8%。参与者对SAM的易用性和效果给予好评。SAM不仅提升学习效果，还赋予学生自主权，预示着在线教育工具的美好未来。

> In online education, innovative tools are crucial for enhancing learning outcomes. SAM (Study with AI Mentor) is an advanced platform that integrates educational videos with a context-aware chat interface powered by large language models. SAM encourages students to ask questions and explore unclear concepts in real-time, offering personalized, context-specific assistance, including explanations of formulas, slides, and images. In a crowdsourced user study involving 140 participants, SAM was evaluated through pre- and post-knowledge tests, comparing a group using SAM with a control group. The results demonstrated that SAM users achieved greater knowledge gains, with a 96.8% answer accuracy. Participants also provided positive feedback on SAM's usability and effectiveness. SAM's proactive approach to learning not only enhances learning outcomes but also empowers students to take full ownership of their educational experience, representing a promising future direction for online learning tools.
