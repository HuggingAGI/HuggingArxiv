> NER-Luxury: Named entity recognition for the fashion and luxury domain

# 摘要

> 本研究针对时尚与奢侈品行业英语命名实体识别模型的开发难题，如实体消歧、法语专业术语、ESG方法论稀缺及公司结构差异等，提出解决方案。我们设计了包含36种以上实体类型的分类法，并构建了4万句子的数据集，确保层次分明。此外，我们开发了五个针对不同奢侈品领域的NER-Luxury模型，兼顾美学与量化分析。实验结果表明，定制NER模型在性能上优于现有开源大型语言模型，为机器学习流程带来显著提升。

> In this study, we address multiple challenges of developing a named-entity recognition model in English for the fashion and luxury industry, namely the entity disambiguation, French technical jargon in multiple sub-sectors, scarcity of the ESG methodology, and a disparate company structures of the sector with small and medium-sized luxury houses to large conglomerate leveraging economy of scale.
  In this work, we introduce a taxonomy of 36+ entity types with a luxury-oriented annotation scheme, and create a dataset of more than 40K sentences respecting a clear hierarchical classification. We also present five supervised fine-tuned models NER-Luxury for fashion, beauty, watches, jewelry, fragrances, cosmetics, and overall luxury, focusing equally on the aesthetic side and the quantitative side.
  In an additional experiment, we compare in a quantitative empirical assessment of the NER performance of our models against the state-of-the-art open-source large language models that show promising results and highlights the benefits of incorporating a bespoke NER model in existing machine learning pipelines.
