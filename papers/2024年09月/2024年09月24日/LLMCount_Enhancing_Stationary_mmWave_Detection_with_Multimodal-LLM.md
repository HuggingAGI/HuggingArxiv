# 摘要

> 毫米波传感技术以非侵入、隐私保护的方式感知人群，潜力巨大。然而，检测静止人群因微小动作（如呼吸）易被误认为噪声而充满挑战。信号功率的不均匀分布也增加了检测难度。为此，我们推出了LLMCount，首个利用大型语言模型（LLM）提升人群检测的系统。通过LLM的决策能力，我们能均匀信号功率，实现更高精度检测。在不同场景（如大厅、会议室、电影院）的全面评估中，LLMCount以低延迟实现了高检测精度，优于以往方法。

> Millimeter wave sensing provides people with the capability of sensing the surrounding crowds in a non-invasive and privacy-preserving manner, which holds huge application potential. However, detecting stationary crowds remains challenging due to several factors such as minimal movements (like breathing or casual fidgets), which can be easily treated as noise clusters during data collection and consequently filtered in the following processing procedures. Additionally, the uneven distribution of signal power due to signal power attenuation and interferences resulting from external reflectors or absorbers further complicates accurate detection. To address these challenges and enable stationary crowd detection across various application scenarios requiring specialized domain adaption, we introduce LLMCount, the first system to harness the capabilities of large-language models (LLMs) to enhance crowd detection performance. By exploiting the decision-making capability of LLM, we can successfully compensate the signal power to acquire a uniform distribution and thereby achieve a detection with higher accuracy. To assess the system's performance, comprehensive evaluations are conducted under diversified scenarios like hall, meeting room, and cinema. The evaluation results show that our proposed approach reaches high detection accuracy with lower overall latency compared with previous methods.
