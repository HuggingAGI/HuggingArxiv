> CHBench: A Chinese Dataset for Evaluating Health in Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 随着 LLM 的迅猛发展，评估其在健康查询中的表现变得尤为关键。这些模型必须提供准确可信的健康信息，因为它们在现实世界中的应用——尤其是在医疗咨询中——依赖于其可靠性。为此，我们推出了 CHBench，首个全面的中文健康基准，涵盖 6,493 条心理健康和 2,999 条身体健康条目，旨在评估 LLM 在多样场景下对身心健康的理解能力。我们的评估显示，尽管这些模型在许多方面表现出色，但在健康信息的理解上仍有显著提升空间。代码已公开，详见 https://github.com/TracyGuo2001/CHBench。

> With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), assessing their performance on health-related inquiries has become increasingly essential. It is critical that these models provide accurate and trustworthy health information, as their application in real-world contexts--where misinformation can have serious consequences for individuals seeking medical advice and support--depends on their reliability. In this work, we present CHBench, the first comprehensive Chinese Health-related Benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in understanding physical and mental health across diverse scenarios. CHBench includes 6,493 entries related to mental health and 2,999 entries focused on physical health, covering a broad spectrum of topics. This dataset serves as a foundation for evaluating Chinese LLMs' capacity to comprehend and generate accurate health-related information. Our extensive evaluations of four popular Chinese LLMs demonstrate that there remains considerable room for improvement in their understanding of health-related information.
