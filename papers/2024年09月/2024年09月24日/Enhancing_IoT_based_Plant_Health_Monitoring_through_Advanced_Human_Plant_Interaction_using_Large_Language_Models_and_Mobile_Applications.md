# 摘要

> 本文展示了一款创新植物通信应用的开发，该应用利用实时传感器数据和 AI 语言模型，让植物与人类“对话”。通过土壤传感器监测水分、温度和养分，系统将数据传至 Gemini API 处理，转化为植物健康和“情绪”的自然语言反馈。应用采用 Flutter、Firebase 和 ThingSpeak 构建，提供流畅的实时交互体验。此系统不仅提升了植物护理，推动了可持续性，还在个人和农业领域开创了 AI 与物联网技术的新应用。文章深入探讨了其技术架构、系统整合及 AI 驱动植物通信的深远影响。

> This paper presents the development of a novel plant communication application that allows plants to "talk" to humans using real-time sensor data and AI-powered language models. Utilizing soil sensors that track moisture, temperature, and nutrient levels, the system feeds this data into the Gemini API, where it is processed and transformed into natural language insights about the plant's health and "mood." Developed using Flutter, Firebase, and ThingSpeak, the app offers a seamless user experience with real-time interaction capabilities. By fostering human-plant connectivity, this system enhances plant care practices, promotes sustainability, and introduces innovative applications for AI and IoT technologies in both personal and agricultural contexts. The paper explores the technical architecture, system integration, and broader implications of AI-driven plant communication.
