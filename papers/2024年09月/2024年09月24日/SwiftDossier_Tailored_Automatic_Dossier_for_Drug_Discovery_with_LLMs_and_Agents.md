# 摘要

> 人工智能算法的进步使其在生物医学等领域的应用更加广泛。大型语言模型 (LLM) 在药物发现中尤为重要，但它们缺乏特定领域的深入知识，且可能生成错误信息。此外，它们无法执行需要外部工具的复杂任务。我们的研究针对这两个问题：首先，通过先进的 RAG 系统，我们提升了 LLM 在药物发现相关问题上的回答准确性；其次，我们展示了如何结合外部工具，使 LLM 能够自动创建包含详尽信息的目标档案，并以 PDF 和 PowerPoint 形式呈现。

> The advancement of artificial intelligence algorithms has expanded their application to several fields such as the biomedical domain. Artificial intelligence systems, including Large Language Models (LLMs), can be particularly advantageous in drug discovery, which is a very long and expensive process. However, LLMs by themselves lack in-depth knowledge about specific domains and can generate factually incorrect information. Moreover, they are not able to perform more complex actions that imply the usage of external tools. Our work is focused on these two issues. Firstly, we show how the implementation of an advanced RAG system can help the LLM to generate more accurate answers to drug-discovery-related questions. The results show that the answers generated by the LLM with the RAG system surpass in quality the answers produced by the model without RAG. Secondly, we show how to create an automatic target dossier using LLMs and incorporating them with external tools that they can use to execute more intricate tasks to gather data such as accessing databases and executing code. The result is a production-ready target dossier containing the acquired information summarized into a PDF and a PowerPoint presentation.
