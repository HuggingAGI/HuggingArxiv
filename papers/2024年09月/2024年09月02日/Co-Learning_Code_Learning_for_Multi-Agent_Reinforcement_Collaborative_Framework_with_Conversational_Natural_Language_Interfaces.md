# 摘要

> 基于LLM的在线问答系统正从娱乐转向专业领域。本文介绍了一个名为Co-Learning社区的多智能体框架，结合E-RL技术，助力初学者独立修正代码错误。通过评估702个错误代码的数据集，该框架设定了E-RL的奖惩机制，分析错误代码并选择最佳LLM智能体，以提高修正准确性和效率。实验表明，与传统方法相比，精确度提升3%，时间节省15%。源代码已公开，详见：\href{https://github.com/yuqian2003/Co_Learning}{https://github.com/yuqian2003/Co\_Learning}。

> Online question-and-answer (Q\&A) systems based on the Large Language Model (LLM) have progressively diverged from recreational to professional use. This paper proposed a Multi-Agent framework with environmentally reinforcement learning (E-RL) for code correction called Code Learning (Co-Learning) community, assisting beginners to correct code errors independently. It evaluates the performance of multiple LLMs from an original dataset with 702 error codes, uses it as a reward or punishment criterion for E-RL; Analyzes input error codes by the current agent; selects the appropriate LLM-based agent to achieve optimal error correction accuracy and reduce correction time. Experiment results showed that 3\% improvement in Precision score and 15\% improvement in time cost as compared with no E-RL method respectively.
