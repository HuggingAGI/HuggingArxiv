> Towards General Industrial Intelligence: A Survey on IIoT-Enhanced Continual Large Models

# 摘要

> 当前，工业物联网 (IIoT) 的应用大多仍依赖于基于 CNN 的神经网络。尽管基于 Transformer 的大型模型 (LMs) 在 AI 生成内容 (AIGC) 领域表现出色，但其在工业领域的应用，如检测、规划和控制，仍较为有限。在工业环境中部署预训练 LMs 时，常面临稳定性和可塑性的挑战，这源于任务的复杂性、数据的多样性及用户需求的动态变化。为此，预训练与微调结合持续学习的策略被证明是有效途径，使模型能适应动态需求并持续优化推理与决策能力。本文探讨了 LMs 与 IIoT 增强的通用工业智能 (GII) 的融合，聚焦于两个核心领域：GII 的 LMs 和 GII 上的 LMs。前者旨在利用 LMs 为工业应用难题提供优化方案，后者则研究在工业设备、边缘计算与云计算协同场景中 LMs 学习和推理能力的持续提升。本文旨在为 GII 的未来发展提供洞见，构建全面的理论框架和研究方向，推动 GII 向更通用、更具适应性的方向迈进。

> Currently, most applications in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) still rely on CNN-based neural networks. Although Transformer-based large models (LMs), including language, vision, and multimodal models, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in AI-generated content (AIGC), their application in industrial domains, such as detection, planning, and control, remains relatively limited. Deploying pre-trained LMs in industrial environments often encounters the challenge of stability and plasticity due to the complexity of tasks, the diversity of data, and the dynamic nature of user demands. To address these challenges, the pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, coupled with continual learning, has proven to be an effective solution, enabling models to adapt to dynamic demands while continuously optimizing their inference and decision-making capabilities. This paper surveys the integration of LMs into IIoT-enhanced General Industrial Intelligence (GII), focusing on two key areas: LMs for GII and LMs on GII. The former focuses on leveraging LMs to provide optimized solutions for industrial application challenges, while the latter investigates continuous optimization of LMs learning and inference capabilities in collaborative scenarios involving industrial devices, edge computing, and cloud computing. This paper provides insights into the future development of GII, aiming to establish a comprehensive theoretical framework and research direction for GII, thereby advancing GII towards a more general and adaptive future.
