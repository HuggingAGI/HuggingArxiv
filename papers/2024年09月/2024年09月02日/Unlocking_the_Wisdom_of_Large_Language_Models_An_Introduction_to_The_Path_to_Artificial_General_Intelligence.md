# 摘要

> 《解锁大型语言模型的智慧》这本小册子，作为《通向人工通用智能之路》的引子，通过九则格言，浓缩了对抗性LLM对话中揭示的AI未来探索的核心见解与原则。我们视此法为通往AGI的一条可能之路。此外，小册子还囊括了主书各章的标题、摘要及引言，并完整展示了首两章。

> This booklet, "Unlocking the Wisdom of Large Language Models," serves as an introduction to the comprehensive work "The Path to Artificial General Intelligence." Through a series of nine aphorisms, we distill key insights and principles that underpin the larger exploration of AI's future through adversarial LLM dialogue. We propose this approach as a potential path to realizing artificial general intelligence (AGI). This booklet also includes the titles, abstracts, and introductions of the chapters in the main book, and presents the first two chapters in their entirety.
