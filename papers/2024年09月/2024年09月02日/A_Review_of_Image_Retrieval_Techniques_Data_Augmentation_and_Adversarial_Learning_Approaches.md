# 摘要

> 图像检索作为计算机视觉的核心研究领域，其应用范围从在线购物到安防监控无所不包。得益于深度学习的发展，图像检索的精度和效率近年来大幅提升。尽管如此，现有技术在处理大规模数据、跨领域检索及应对现实场景中的图像扰动（如光照、遮挡和视角变化）时仍显不足。为此，数据增强与对抗学习技术被广泛采用，前者通过丰富训练样本提升模型泛化与鲁棒性，后者则通过训练中的扰动增强模型对抗攻击的能力，确保实际应用的可靠性。本文综述了图像检索领域的最新进展，特别探讨了数据增强与对抗学习在提升检索性能中的关键作用，并对未来的研究方向与挑战进行了展望。

> Image retrieval is a crucial research topic in computer vision, with broad application prospects ranging from online product searches to security surveillance systems. In recent years, the accuracy and efficiency of image retrieval have significantly improved due to advancements in deep learning. However, existing methods still face numerous challenges, particularly in handling large-scale datasets, cross-domain retrieval, and image perturbations that can arise from real-world conditions such as variations in lighting, occlusion, and viewpoint. Data augmentation techniques and adversarial learning methods have been widely applied in the field of image retrieval to address these challenges. Data augmentation enhances the model's generalization ability and robustness by generating more diverse training samples, simulating real-world variations, and reducing overfitting. Meanwhile, adversarial attacks and defenses introduce perturbations during training to improve the model's robustness against potential attacks, ensuring reliability in practical applications. This review comprehensively summarizes the latest research advancements in image retrieval, with a particular focus on the roles of data augmentation and adversarial learning techniques in enhancing retrieval performance. Future directions and potential challenges are also discussed.
