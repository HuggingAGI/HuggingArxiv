> SOOD-ImageNet: a Large-Scale Dataset for Semantic Out-Of-Distribution Image Classification and Semantic Segmentation

# 摘要

> 计算机视觉中的分布外（OOD）检测研究至关重要，相关基准对于评估模型在现实应用中的泛化能力尤为关键。然而，现有OOD基准存在两大局限：一是忽视语义偏移的挑战，二是规模相对较小。为此，我们推出了SOOD-ImageNet数据集，包含约160万张图片，覆盖56个类别，专为OOD条件下的图像分类和语义分割设计，特别聚焦于语义偏移问题。我们通过创新数据引擎确保了数据集的规模和质量，该引擎结合了现代视觉-语言模型的优势和精准的人工审核。在SOOD-ImageNet上对多种模型进行广泛训练和评估后，我们证实了其对推动OOD研究的重要作用。项目详情请访问：https://github.com/bach05/SOODImageNet.git。

> Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection in computer vision is a crucial research area, with related benchmarks playing a vital role in assessing the generalizability of models and their applicability in real-world scenarios. However, existing OOD benchmarks in the literature suffer from two main limitations: (1) they often overlook semantic shift as a potential challenge, and (2) their scale is limited compared to the large datasets used to train modern models. To address these gaps, we introduce SOOD-ImageNet, a novel dataset comprising around 1.6M images across 56 classes, designed for common computer vision tasks such as image classification and semantic segmentation under OOD conditions, with a particular focus on the issue of semantic shift. We ensured the necessary scalability and quality by developing an innovative data engine that leverages the capabilities of modern vision-language models, complemented by accurate human checks. Through extensive training and evaluation of various models on SOOD-ImageNet, we showcase its potential to significantly advance OOD research in computer vision.
