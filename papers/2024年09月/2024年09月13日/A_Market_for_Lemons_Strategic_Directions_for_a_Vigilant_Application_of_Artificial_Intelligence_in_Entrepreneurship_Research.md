> A Market for Lemons? Strategic Directions for a Vigilant Application of Artificial Intelligence in Entrepreneurship Research

# 摘要

> 随着 AI 技术的广泛应用（如机器学习、深度学习及大型语言模型）和大数据的普及，创业学领域正迎来前所未有的变革。本文指出，在 AI 革命的浪潮中，创业研究面临知识交流低效的重大风险。为此，我们提出应对策略，并指导未来基于 AI 的研究，以提升其影响力和相关性。借鉴 Akerlof 的柠檬市场理论，我们发现，随着领域的发展，知识不对称性日益显著（如构念有效性、理论构建及研究相关性的复杂性）。这种不对称性源于“双重黑箱”难题：AI 方法的不可解释性与创业现象的不确定性相互交织。这可能导致次优研究产品的增加，形成“柠檬市场”，损害领域的健康发展、声誉及影响力。然而，若能有效应对这些风险，AI 革命或将开启创业研究的新纪元。我们探讨了提升领域 AI 韧性、坚守基础原则和核心价值观的必要措施。

> The rapid expansion of AI adoption (e.g., using machine learning, deep learning, or large language models as research methods) and the increasing availability of big data have the potential to bring about the most significant transformation in entrepreneurship scholarship the field has ever witnessed. This article makes a pressing meta-contribution by highlighting a significant risk of unproductive knowledge exchanges in entrepreneurship research amid the AI revolution. It offers strategies to mitigate this risk and provides guidance for future AI-based studies to enhance their collective impact and relevance. Drawing on Akerlof's renowned market-for-lemons concept, we identify the potential for significant knowledge asymmetries emerging from the field's evolution into its current landscape (e.g., complexities around construct validity, theory building, and research relevance). Such asymmetries are particularly deeply ingrained due to what we term the double-black-box puzzle, where the widely recognized black box nature of AI methods intersects with the black box nature of the entrepreneurship phenomenon driven by inherent uncertainty. As a result, these asymmetries could lead to an increase in suboptimal research products that go undetected, collectively creating a market for lemons that undermines the field's well-being, reputation, and impact. However, importantly, if these risks can be mitigated, the AI revolution could herald a new golden era for entrepreneurship research. We discuss the necessary actions to elevate the field to a higher level of AI resilience while steadfastly maintaining its foundational principles and core values.
