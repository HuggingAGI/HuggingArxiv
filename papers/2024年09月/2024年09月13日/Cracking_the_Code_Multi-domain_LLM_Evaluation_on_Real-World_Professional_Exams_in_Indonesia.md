# 摘要

> 大型语言模型的知识评估多聚焦于学术科目，却常忽略职业实际需求。本文介绍的 IndoCareer 数据集，包含 8,834 道多选题，专为评估职业认证考试设计，覆盖印尼六大关键领域。评估显示，模型在保险和金融等本地化强的领域表现不佳。打乱答案虽维持整体评估稳定，但在保险和金融领域却引发不稳定性。

> While knowledge evaluation in large language models has predominantly focused on academic subjects like math and physics, these assessments often fail to capture the practical demands of real-world professions. In this paper, we introduce IndoCareer, a dataset comprising 8,834 multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate performance in vocational and professional certification exams across various fields. With a focus on Indonesia, IndoCareer provides rich local contexts, spanning six key sectors: (1) healthcare, (2) insurance and finance, (3) creative and design, (4) tourism and hospitality, (5) education and training, and (6) law. Our comprehensive evaluation of 27 large language models shows that these models struggle particularly in fields with strong local contexts, such as insurance and finance. Additionally, while using the entire dataset, shuffling answer options generally maintains consistent evaluation results across models, but it introduces instability specifically in the insurance and finance sectors.
