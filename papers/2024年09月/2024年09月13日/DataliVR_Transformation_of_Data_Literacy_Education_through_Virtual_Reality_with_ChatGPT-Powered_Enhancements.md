# 摘要

> 在数据驱动的时代，数据素养至关重要，它要求个人能够有效管理和解读数据。然而，传统课堂教育往往难以全面覆盖数据素养的复杂性。随着教育数字化转型，虚拟现实（VR）等创新技术为沉浸式学习提供了新途径。本文介绍的DataliVR，是一款通过情境化和游戏化VR环境提升大学生数据素养的先锋应用。它结合了ChatGPT作为虚拟助教，提供个性化学习支持，增强学习体验。我们的实验研究以聊天机器人为变量，分析了三十名参与者的学习效果，结果显示ChatGPT显著提升了学习体验和成果。DataliVR不仅有效且用户友好，还通过前沿的VR和AI技术，大力推动了数据素养教育的数字化进程。此外，我们的研究为未来整合LLMs到教育VR平台的探索提供了重要参考。

> Data literacy is essential in today's data-driven world, emphasizing individuals' abilities to effectively manage data and extract meaningful insights. However, traditional classroom-based educational approaches often struggle to fully address the multifaceted nature of data literacy. As education undergoes digital transformation, innovative technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) offer promising avenues for immersive and engaging learning experiences. This paper introduces DataliVR, a pioneering VR application aimed at enhancing the data literacy skills of university students within a contextual and gamified virtual learning environment. By integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT as a conversational artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot embodied within a virtual avatar, DataliVR provides personalized learning assistance, enriching user learning experiences. Our study employed an experimental approach, with chatbot availability as the independent variable, analyzing learning experiences and outcomes as dependent variables with a sample of thirty participants. Our approach underscores the effectiveness and user-friendliness of ChatGPT-powered DataliVR in fostering data literacy skills. Moreover, our study examines the impact of the ChatGPT-based AI chatbot on users' learning, revealing significant effects on both learning experiences and outcomes. Our study presents a robust tool for fostering data literacy skills, contributing significantly to the digital advancement of data literacy education through cutting-edge VR and AI technologies. Moreover, our research provides valuable insights and implications for future research endeavors aiming to integrate LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) into educational VR platforms.
