# 摘要

> 大型语言模型 (LLM) 已从文本系统迅速演变为多模态平台，深刻影响医疗保健等领域。本文综述了 LLM 向多模态大型语言模型 (MLLM) 的转变及其在医疗实践中的影响。我们分析了 MLLM 在临床决策、医学影像、患者互动和研究中的应用，并强调其整合文本、图像和音频数据的独特能力，以提供更全面的病人健康见解。同时，我们探讨了 MLLM 实施中的挑战，如数据限制、技术难题和伦理问题。通过识别研究空白，本文旨在指导未来在数据集开发、模态对齐和伦理指南建立等领域的研究。随着 MLLM 重塑医疗保健，理解其潜力与局限性对于其负责任和有效的应用至关重要。

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved from text-based systems to multimodal platforms, significantly impacting various sectors including healthcare. This comprehensive review explores the progression of LLMs to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and their growing influence in medical practice. We examine the current landscape of MLLMs in healthcare, analyzing their applications across clinical decision support, medical imaging, patient engagement, and research. The review highlights the unique capabilities of MLLMs in integrating diverse data types, such as text, images, and audio, to provide more comprehensive insights into patient health. We also address the challenges facing MLLM implementation, including data limitations, technical hurdles, and ethical considerations. By identifying key research gaps, this paper aims to guide future investigations in areas such as dataset development, modality alignment methods, and the establishment of ethical guidelines. As MLLMs continue to shape the future of healthcare, understanding their potential and limitations is crucial for their responsible and effective integration into medical practice.
