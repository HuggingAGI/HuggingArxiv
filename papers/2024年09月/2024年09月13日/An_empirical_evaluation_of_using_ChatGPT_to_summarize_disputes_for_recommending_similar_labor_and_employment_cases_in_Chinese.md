> An empirical evaluation of using ChatGPT to summarize disputes for recommending similar labor and employment cases in Chinese

# 摘要

> 我们设计了一种混合推荐机制，用于识别劳动和就业诉讼中的相似案例。分类器通过分析法院准备的明细争议来判断案例相似度。我们聚类争议，计算其余弦相似度，并将其作为分类特征。实验显示，这种混合方法超越了我们之前的系统，后者仅依赖争议聚类信息。我们用GPT-3.5和GPT-4生成的明细争议替代了法院准备的争议，并重复实验。结果表明，GPT-4生成的争议效果更佳。尽管ChatGPT生成的争议表现稍逊，但整体结果令人满意。我们期待未来大型语言模型能在实际应用中发挥更大作用。

> We present a hybrid mechanism for recommending similar cases of labor and employment litigations. The classifier determines the similarity based on the itemized disputes of the two cases, that the courts prepared. We cluster the disputes, compute the cosine similarity between the disputes, and use the results as the features for the classification tasks. Experimental results indicate that this hybrid approach outperformed our previous system, which considered only the information about the clusters of the disputes. We replaced the disputes that were prepared by the courts with the itemized disputes that were generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and repeated the same experiments. Using the disputes generated by GPT-4 led to better results. Although our classifier did not perform as well when using the disputes that the ChatGPT generated, the results were satisfactory. Hence, we hope that the future large-language models will become practically useful.
