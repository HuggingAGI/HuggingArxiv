> Mutual Theory of Mind in Human-AI Collaboration: An Empirical Study with LLM-driven AI Agents in a Real-time Shared Workspace Task

# 摘要

> ToM 作为理解他人的关键能力，极大地影响了人类的协作与沟通。在人机团队中，当 AI 具备 ToM 能力时，便会出现 MToM 现象。MToM 过程通过互动沟通和策略调整，影响团队表现与协作。我们通过实验发现，AI 的 ToM 能力虽不影响团队表现，但能增进人类对 AI 的理解与共鸣。多数参与者认为口头沟通增加了负担，且双向沟通反而降低了团队表现。这些发现为设计实时协作的 AI 提供了重要启示。

> Theory of Mind (ToM) significantly impacts human collaboration and communication as a crucial capability to understand others. When AI agents with ToM capability collaborate with humans, Mutual Theory of Mind (MToM) arises in such human-AI teams (HATs). The MToM process, which involves interactive communication and ToM-based strategy adjustment, affects the team's performance and collaboration process. To explore the MToM process, we conducted a mixed-design experiment using a large language model-driven AI agent with ToM and communication modules in a real-time shared-workspace task. We find that the agent's ToM capability does not significantly impact team performance but enhances human understanding of the agent and the feeling of being understood. Most participants in our study believe verbal communication increases human burden, and the results show that bidirectional communication leads to lower HAT performance. We discuss the results' implications for designing AI agents that collaborate with humans in real-time shared workspace tasks.
