> Language Models as Zero-shot Lossless Gradient Compressors: Towards General Neural Parameter Prior Models

# 摘要

> 尽管统计先验模型在多个领域广泛应用，但神经网络梯度的先验模型却长期被忽视。这主要是因为其高维结构和复杂依赖性带来的建模挑战。本文展示了大型语言模型 (LLM) 在零-shot 场景下作为梯度先验的潜力。我们通过无损梯度压缩这一关键应用来验证，该应用对精确概率建模依赖极大。为此，我们提出了 LM-GC 方法，将 LLM 与算术编码结合，将梯度转换为文本格式，令牌效率提升高达 38 倍。实验表明，LM-GC 在多个数据集和架构上，将压缩率提高了 10% 至 17.2%，并兼容有损压缩技术。这些结果凸显了 LLM 在梯度处理方面的巨大潜力。发表后将公开源代码。

> Despite the widespread use of statistical prior models in various fields, such models for neural network gradients have long been overlooked. The inherent challenge stems from their high-dimensional structures and complex interdependencies, which complicate effective modeling. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to act as gradient priors in a zero-shot setting. We examine the property by considering lossless gradient compression -- a critical application in distributed learning -- that depends heavily on precise probability modeling. To achieve this, we introduce LM-GC, a novel method that integrates LLMs with arithmetic coding. Our technique converts plain gradients into text-like formats, enhancing token efficiency by up to 38 times compared to their plain representations. We ensure that this data conversion maintains a close alignment with the structure of plain gradients and the symbols commonly recognized by LLMs. Our experiments indicate that LM-GC surpasses existing state-of-the-art lossless compression methods, improving compression rates by 10\% up to 17.2\% across various datasets and architectures. Additionally, our approach shows promising compatibility with lossy compression techniques such as quantization and sparsification. These findings highlight the significant potential of LLMs as a model for effectively handling gradients. We will release the source code upon publication.
