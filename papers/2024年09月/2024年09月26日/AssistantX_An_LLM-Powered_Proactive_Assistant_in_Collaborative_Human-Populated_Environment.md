> AssistantX: An LLM-Powered Proactive Assistant in Collaborative Human-Populated Environment

# 摘要

> 随着人类居住环境中对智能助手的需求日益增长，自主机器人系统的研究也取得了显著进展。然而，传统服务机器人和虚拟助手在处理现实任务时，由于缺乏动态推理和交互能力，尤其是在需要人类协作时，表现不佳。大型语言模型的进步为此提供了新的解决方案，增强了系统的复杂推理和自然交互能力。本文介绍的 AssistantX，是一款由 LLM 驱动的主动助手，专为物理办公室环境设计，具备自主操作能力。与传统机器人不同，AssistantX 采用创新的 PPDR4X 多代理架构，提供高级推理和全面协作意识。通过无缝连接虚拟与物理世界，AssistantX 在处理复杂现实场景时表现出色。评估显示，AssistantX 不仅能响应指令，还能主动获取信息并寻求团队协作，确保任务顺利完成。更多信息和演示视频请访问 https://assistantx-agent.github.io/AssistantX/。

> The increasing demand for intelligent assistants in human-populated environments has motivated significant research in autonomous robotic systems. Traditional service robots and virtual assistants, however, struggle with real-world task execution due to their limited capacity for dynamic reasoning and interaction, particularly when human collaboration is required. Recent developments in Large Language Models have opened new avenues for improving these systems, enabling more sophisticated reasoning and natural interaction capabilities. In this paper, we introduce AssistantX, an LLM-powered proactive assistant designed to operate autonomously in a physical office environment. Unlike conventional service robots, AssistantX leverages a novel multi-agent architecture, PPDR4X, which provides advanced inference capabilities and comprehensive collaboration awareness. By effectively bridging the gap between virtual operations and physical interactions, AssistantX demonstrates robust performance in managing complex real-world scenarios. Our evaluation highlights the architecture's effectiveness, showing that AssistantX can respond to clear instructions, actively retrieve supplementary information from memory, and proactively seek collaboration from team members to ensure successful task completion.
