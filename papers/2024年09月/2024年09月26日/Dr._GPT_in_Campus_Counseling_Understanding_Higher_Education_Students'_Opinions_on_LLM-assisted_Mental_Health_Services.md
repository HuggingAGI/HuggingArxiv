> Dr. GPT in Campus Counseling: Understanding Higher Education Students' Opinions on LLM-assisted Mental Health Services

# 摘要

> 面对大学生日益严峻的心理健康问题，我们深入探讨了他们如何看待人工智能，尤其是大型语言模型（LLMs）在提升心理健康方面的潜力。通过与十名学生的访谈，我们分析了他们在五个虚构场景中对LLMs的看法：信息查询、初步筛查、重塑医患关系、长期护理和后续关怀。结果显示，学生对LLMs的接受度因场景而异，既看到了其如主动参与和个性化关怀的优点，也担忧其训练数据和情感支持的局限。这些发现为设计和实施AI技术提供了方向，确保在补充传统方法的同时，保持同理心并尊重个人需求，从而有效支持学生的心理健康。

> In response to the increasing mental health challenges faced by college students, we sought to understand their perspectives on how AI applications, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), can be leveraged to enhance their mental well-being. Through pilot interviews with ten diverse students, we explored their opinions on the use of LLMs across five fictional scenarios: General Information Inquiry, Initial Screening, Reshaping Patient-Expert Dynamics, Long-term Care, and Follow-up Care. Our findings revealed that students' acceptance of LLMs varied by scenario, with participants highlighting both potential benefits, such as proactive engagement and personalized follow-up care, and concerns, including limitations in training data and emotional support. These insights inform how AI technology should be designed and implemented to effectively support and enhance students' mental well-being, particularly in scenarios where LLMs can complement traditional methods, while maintaining empathy and respecting individual preferences.
