> Graph Reasoning with Large Language Models via Pseudo-code Prompting

# 摘要

> 近期，大型语言模型（LLM）在自然语言处理领域的推理任务中表现出色，并激发了其在图相关任务中的应用。尽管 LLM 已具备初步的图推理能力，但在处理某些简单图问题时仍显不足。本文探讨了伪代码指令提示对 LLM 解决图问题性能的影响。实验结果显示，伪代码指令显著提升了 LLM 的表现。相关图数据、伪代码提示及评估代码均已公开。

> Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable success in various reasoning tasks in the field of natural language processing. This success of LLMs has also motivated their use in graph-related tasks. Among others, recent work has explored whether LLMs can solve graph problems such as counting the number of connected components of a graph or computing the shortest path distance between two nodes. Although LLMs possess preliminary graph reasoning abilities, they might still struggle to solve some seemingly simple problems. In this paper, we investigate whether prompting via pseudo-code instructions can improve the performance of LLMs in solving graph problems. Our experiments demonstrate that using pseudo-code instructions generally improves the performance of all considered LLMs. The graphs, pseudo-code prompts, and evaluation code are publicly available.
