# 摘要

> 从庞大复杂的数据中提炼真知灼见，挑战重重，尤其是在确保信息检索的精准与相关性上。传统方法如顺序搜索和索引检索，面对错综复杂的数据结构时，常力不从心，导致信息残缺或误导。为此，我们推出Structured-GraphRAG，一个旨在提升自然语言查询中结构化数据检索的多功能框架。它借助多重知识图谱，以结构化形式呈现数据，并捕捉实体间复杂关联，实现更细腻全面的信息提取。基于图谱的方法，通过结构化响应，大幅降低语言模型输出的错误率，提升结果可信度。我们通过对比Structured-GraphRAG与传统检索增强生成方法的性能，验证了其卓越效果，显著提速查询处理并缩短响应时间。尽管案例聚焦于足球数据，该框架的普适性使其成为数据分析的利器，广泛赋能各结构化领域的语言模型应用。

> Extracting meaningful insights from large and complex datasets poses significant challenges, particularly in ensuring the accuracy and relevance of retrieved information. Traditional data retrieval methods such as sequential search and index-based retrieval often fail when handling intricate and interconnected data structures, resulting in incomplete or misleading outputs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Structured-GraphRAG, a versatile framework designed to enhance information retrieval across structured datasets in natural language queries. Structured-GraphRAG utilizes multiple knowledge graphs, which represent data in a structured format and capture complex relationships between entities, enabling a more nuanced and comprehensive retrieval of information. This graph-based approach reduces the risk of errors in language model outputs by grounding responses in a structured format, thereby enhancing the reliability of results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Structured-GraphRAG by comparing its performance with that of a recently published method using traditional retrieval-augmented generation. Our findings show that Structured-GraphRAG significantly improves query processing efficiency and reduces response times. While our case study focuses on soccer data, the framework's design is broadly applicable, offering a powerful tool for data analysis and enhancing language model applications across various structured domains.
