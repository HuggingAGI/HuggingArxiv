> Retrospective Comparative Analysis of Prostate Cancer In-Basket Messages: Responses from Closed-Domain LLM vs. Clinical Teams

# 摘要

> In-basket 消息交互在医患沟通中至关重要，贯穿患者护理全程。然而，回应这些询问已成为医疗工作流程的重担，耗费临床团队大量时间。为此，我们推出了 RadOnc-GPT，一个由 GPT-4 驱动的 LLM，专为前列腺癌放射治疗设计，并结合先进提示工程，旨在协助生成回应。RadOnc-GPT 与患者 EHR 系统集成，涵盖医院范围及放射肿瘤学特定数据库。在 158 个历史消息交互中，RadOnc-GPT 通过 NLP 分析及临床医生和护士的评分研究进行评估。结果显示，RadOnc-GPT 在“清晰度”和“同理心”上略胜一筹，在“完整性”和“正确性”上与临床团队持平。RadOnc-GPT 预计为护士每条消息节省 5.2 分钟，为临床医生节省 2.4 分钟。采用 RadOnc-GPT 生成消息草稿，有望减轻临床团队负担，通过高效回应降低医疗成本。

> In-basket message interactions play a crucial role in physician-patient communication, occurring during all phases (pre-, during, and post) of a patient's care journey. However, responding to these patients' inquiries has become a significant burden on healthcare workflows, consuming considerable time for clinical care teams. To address this, we introduce RadOnc-GPT, a specialized Large Language Model (LLM) powered by GPT-4 that has been designed with a focus on radiotherapeutic treatment of prostate cancer with advanced prompt engineering, and specifically designed to assist in generating responses. We integrated RadOnc-GPT with patient electronic health records (EHR) from both the hospital-wide EHR database and an internal, radiation-oncology-specific database. RadOnc-GPT was evaluated on 158 previously recorded in-basket message interactions. Quantitative natural language processing (NLP) analysis and two grading studies with clinicians and nurses were used to assess RadOnc-GPT's responses. Our findings indicate that RadOnc-GPT slightly outperformed the clinical care team in "Clarity" and "Empathy," while achieving comparable scores in "Completeness" and "Correctness." RadOnc-GPT is estimated to save 5.2 minutes per message for nurses and 2.4 minutes for clinicians, from reading the inquiry to sending the response. Employing RadOnc-GPT for in-basket message draft generation has the potential to alleviate the workload of clinical care teams and reduce healthcare costs by producing high-quality, timely responses.
