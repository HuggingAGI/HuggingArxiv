# 摘要

> 评估 LLM 在教育任务中协助师生能力的研究日益增多。本文中，我们测试了 ChatGPT 解决和评分西班牙语计算机科学学位中的编程考试的能力。结果显示，该 AI 仅在简单编码任务中表现良好，而在处理复杂问题或评估他人解决方案时效果不佳。此外，我们还发布了一个新的编程任务语料库及相应提示，供其他研究团队使用。

> Evaluating the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist teachers and students in educational tasks is receiving increasing attention. In this paper, we assess ChatGPT's capacities to solve and grade real programming exams, from an accredited BSc degree in Computer Science, written in Spanish. Our findings suggest that this AI model is only effective for solving simple coding tasks. Its proficiency in tackling complex problems or evaluating solutions authored by others are far from effective. As part of this research, we also release a new corpus of programming tasks and the corresponding prompts for solving the problems or grading the solutions. This resource can be further exploited by other research teams.
