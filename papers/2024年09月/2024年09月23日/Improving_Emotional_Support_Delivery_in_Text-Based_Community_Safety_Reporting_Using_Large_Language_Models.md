> Improving Emotional Support Delivery in Text-Based Community Safety Reporting Using Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 情感支持在社区成员与警察调度员的沟通中至关重要，但基于文本系统的情感支持机制仍未被充分理解，尤其是在非紧急情况下。我们分析了两年内来自130所高校的8,239起事件中的57,114条聊天记录，发现调度员的情感支持因事件类型、服务时间和组织差异而显著不同。为提升支持质量，我们开发了名为dispatcherLLM的微调LLM，并通过真实聊天数据对比其与人类调度员及其他模型的表现。此外，我们进行了人类评估，验证了dispatcherLLM的支持效果。本研究不仅深化了对文本调度系统中情感支持的理解，还展示了生成式AI在服务改进中的巨大潜力。

> Emotional support is a crucial aspect of communication between community members and police dispatchers during incident reporting. However, there is a lack of understanding about how emotional support is delivered through text-based systems, especially in various non-emergency contexts. In this study, we analyzed two years of chat logs comprising 57,114 messages across 8,239 incidents from 130 higher education institutions. Our empirical findings revealed significant variations in emotional support provided by dispatchers, influenced by the type of incident, service time, and a noticeable decline in support over time across multiple organizations. To improve the consistency and quality of emotional support, we developed and implemented a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM), named dispatcherLLM. We evaluated dispatcherLLM by comparing its generated responses to those of human dispatchers and other off-the-shelf models using real chat messages. Additionally, we conducted a human evaluation to assess the perceived effectiveness of the support provided by dispatcherLLM. This study not only contributes new empirical understandings of emotional support in text-based dispatch systems but also demonstrates the significant potential of generative AI in improving service delivery.
