> A Survey of Stance Detection on Social Media: New Directions and Perspectives

# 摘要

> 在当今数字世界中，用户对争议话题的频繁表态，为我们揭示了大众心态的丰富信息。这些意见的系统分析，为营销、政治等多个领域的决策提供了宝贵参考。因此，立场检测作为情感计算的重要分支，不仅能在社交媒体对话中自动识别用户立场，还能深入解析公众对复杂问题的情绪。近年来，自然语言处理、网络科学和社会计算等领域的研究者们，纷纷投身于开发高效的立场检测方法。本文全面梳理了社交媒体上的立场检测技术，从任务定义、数据集到方法和未来展望，逐一剖析。我们不仅回顾了传统模型，还探讨了基于大型语言模型的前沿技术，并指出其优劣。调查显示，立场检测在洞察公众意见和情绪方面至关重要，同时也揭示了当前研究的不足。最后，我们展望了社交媒体立场检测的未来，强调了构建更强大、更通用的模型的重要性，以及应对多模态立场检测和低资源语言中立场检测等新兴挑战的紧迫性。

> In modern digital environments, users frequently express opinions on contentious topics, providing a wealth of information on prevailing attitudes. The systematic analysis of these opinions offers valuable insights for decision-making in various sectors, including marketing and politics. As a result, stance detection has emerged as a crucial subfield within affective computing, enabling the automatic detection of user stances in social media conversations and providing a nuanced understanding of public sentiment on complex issues. Recent years have seen a surge of research interest in developing effective stance detection methods, with contributions from multiple communities, including natural language processing, web science, and social computing. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of stance detection techniques on social media, covering task definitions, datasets, approaches, and future works. We review traditional stance detection models, as well as state-of-the-art methods based on large language models, and discuss their strengths and limitations. Our survey highlights the importance of stance detection in understanding public opinion and sentiment, and identifies gaps in current research. We conclude by outlining potential future directions for stance detection on social media, including the need for more robust and generalizable models, and the importance of addressing emerging challenges such as multi-modal stance detection and stance detection in low-resource languages.
