> Past Meets Present: Creating Historical Analogy with Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 历史类比是将已知的历史事件与当代事件对比，帮助人们决策和理解世界。然而，人们往往难以找到合适的类比，AI研究也忽视了这一点。本文针对这一问题，探索了基于LLMs的检索和生成方法，并提出自我反思技术，以减少幻觉和刻板印象。通过人类评估和多维度自动评估，我们发现LLMs在历史类比方面潜力巨大，且自我反思方法能显著提升模型性能。

> Historical analogies, which compare known past events with contemporary but unfamiliar events, are important abilities that help people make decisions and understand the world. However, research in applied history suggests that people have difficulty finding appropriate analogies. And previous studies in the AI community have also overlooked historical analogies. To fill this gap, in this paper, we focus on the historical analogy acquisition task, which aims to acquire analogous historical events for a given event. We explore retrieval and generation methods for acquiring historical analogies based on different large language models (LLMs). Furthermore, we propose a self-reflection method to mitigate hallucinations and stereotypes when LLMs generate historical analogies. Through human evaluations and our specially designed automatic multi-dimensional assessment, we find that LLMs generally have a good potential for historical analogies. And the performance of the models can be further improved by using our self-reflection method.
