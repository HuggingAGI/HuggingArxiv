# 摘要

> 本研究利用大型语言模型 (LLM) 从社交媒体数据中提升抑郁症检测的准确性。通过微调 GPT 3.5 Turbo 1106 和 LLaMA2-7B 模型，并结合大量历史数据，我们实现了近 96.0% 的高准确率，成功识别出社交媒体中的抑郁内容。与现有研究相比，我们的微调 LLM 系统表现更佳，显示出其在抑郁症检测中的潜力。研究不仅详细介绍了方法和微调过程，还探讨了这些成果在社交媒体上早期诊断抑郁症的应用前景。

> This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for improved depression detection from users social media data. Through the use of fine-tuned GPT 3.5 Turbo 1106 and LLaMA2-7B models and a sizable dataset from earlier studies, we were able to identify depressed content in social media posts with a high accuracy of nearly 96.0 percent. The comparative analysis of the obtained results with the relevant studies in the literature shows that the proposed fine-tuned LLMs achieved enhanced performance compared to existing state of the-art systems. This demonstrates the robustness of LLM-based fine-tuned systems to be used as potential depression detection systems. The study describes the approach in depth, including the parameters used and the fine-tuning procedure, and it addresses the important implications of our results for the early diagnosis of depression on several social media platforms.
