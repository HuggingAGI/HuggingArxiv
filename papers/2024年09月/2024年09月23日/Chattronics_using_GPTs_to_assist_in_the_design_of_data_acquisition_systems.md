> Chattronics: using GPTs to assist in the design of data acquisition systems

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型 (LLM) 在各领域的应用不断被检验，但其内在的语言特性仍是应用于精确科学时的瓶颈。本文提出一种新方法，利用通用预训练变换器辅助数据采集系统的设计。该方案以应用形式呈现，保留了 LLM 的对话特性，用户需提供项目细节，模型则基于 Top-Down 方法绘制系统架构和规格。测试中，两种用户模拟（其一使用额外 GPT 模型）参与，共涉及四个项目：角位置、温度、加速度及同时测量压力和表面温度的项目。经过 160 次迭代，研究显示这些模型有望成为数据采集系统的综合/辅助工具，但技术上仍有局限。结果虽呈现连贯架构和拓扑，但 GPT 在全面考虑需求时易犯理论错误。

> The usefulness of Large Language Models (LLM) is being continuously tested in various fields. However, their intrinsic linguistic characteristic is still one of the limiting factors when applying these models to exact sciences. In this article, a novel approach to use General Pre-Trained Transformers to assist in the design phase of data acquisition systems will be presented. The solution is packaged in the form of an application that retains the conversational aspects of LLMs, in such a manner that the user must provide details on the desired project in order for the model to draft both a system-level architectural diagram and the block-level specifications, following a Top-Down methodology based on restrictions. To test this tool, two distinct user emulations were used, one of which uses an additional GPT model. In total, 4 different data acquisition projects were used in the testing phase, each with its own measurement requirements: angular position, temperature, acceleration and a fourth project with both pressure and superficial temperature measurements. After 160 test iterations, the study concludes that there is potential for these models to serve adequately as synthesis/assistant tools for data acquisition systems, but there are still technological limitations. The results show coherent architectures and topologies, but that GPTs have difficulties in simultaneously considering all requirements and many times commits theoretical mistakes.
