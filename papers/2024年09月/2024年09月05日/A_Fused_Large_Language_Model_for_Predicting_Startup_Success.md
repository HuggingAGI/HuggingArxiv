> A Fused Large Language Model for Predicting Startup Success

# 摘要

> 投资者不断寻找初创公司的盈利机会，因此需要预测其成功概率。如今，投资者不仅能利用初创公司的基本信息，还能借助其创新和商业模式的文本描述，这些信息广泛存在于Crunchbase等VC平台。为辅助投资者决策，我们开发了一种机器学习方法，旨在通过VC平台识别成功初创公司。我们特别定制并训练了一个融合大型语言模型，用于预测初创公司成功，并评估了平台自我描述的预测能力。通过对Crunchbase上20,172个资料的分析，我们发现该模型能有效预测成功，其中文本描述起到了关键作用。这项工作为投资者提供了一个有力的工具，帮助他们发现潜在的盈利机会。

> Investors are continuously seeking profitable investment opportunities in startups and, hence, for effective decision-making, need to predict a startup's probability of success. Nowadays, investors can use not only various fundamental information about a startup (e.g., the age of the startup, the number of founders, and the business sector) but also textual description of a startup's innovation and business model, which is widely available through online venture capital (VC) platforms such as Crunchbase. To support the decision-making of investors, we develop a machine learning approach with the aim of locating successful startups on VC platforms. Specifically, we develop, train, and evaluate a tailored, fused large language model to predict startup success. Thereby, we assess to what extent self-descriptions on VC platforms are predictive of startup success. Using 20,172 online profiles from Crunchbase, we find that our fused large language model can predict startup success, with textual self-descriptions being responsible for a significant part of the predictive power. Our work provides a decision support tool for investors to find profitable investment opportunities.
