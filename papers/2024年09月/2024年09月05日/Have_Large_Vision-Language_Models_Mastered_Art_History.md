# 摘要

> 大型视觉语言模型 (VLMs) 在图像分类领域已树立新标杆，但在艺术品分类，尤其是绘画艺术风格分类这一艺术史学家擅长的领域，其潜力尚未被挖掘。艺术品因其复杂多变的结构，对模型提出了独特挑战。本文探讨了整合视觉与文本数据的 VLMs 能否精准预测绘画的艺术史属性。我们深入分析了 CLIP、LLaVA、OpenFlamingo 和 GPT-4o 四个模型，并利用两个公共艺术品基准进行零-shot 分类测试。此外，我们还推出了 ArTest，一个包含艺术史学家研究关键作品的精选测试集。

> The emergence of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has recently established new baselines in image classification across multiple domains. However, the performance of VLMs in the specific task of artwork classification, particularly art style classification of paintings - a domain traditionally mastered by art historians - has not been explored yet. Artworks pose a unique challenge compared to natural images due to their inherently complex and diverse structures, characterized by variable compositions and styles. Art historians have long studied the unique aspects of artworks, with style prediction being a crucial component of their discipline. This paper investigates whether large VLMs, which integrate visual and textual data, can effectively predict the art historical attributes of paintings. We conduct an in-depth analysis of four VLMs, namely CLIP, LLaVA, OpenFlamingo, and GPT-4o, focusing on zero-shot classification of art style, author and time period using two public benchmarks of artworks. Additionally, we present ArTest, a well-curated test set of artworks, including pivotal paintings studied by art historians.
