# 摘要

> 全球约有5000万人受痴呆症困扰，且每年新增1000万病例。在没有治愈方法的情况下，临床预测和早期干预成为延缓病情进展的关键。人工智能和计算语言学在此背景下，可用于自然语言分析、个性化评估、监测和治疗。然而，传统方法在语义知识管理和解释能力上仍有不足。尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）代表了临床-患者沟通的最新技术，但用于认知衰退诊断的应用仍不多见。为此，我们利用最新的自然语言处理（NLP）技术，开发了一个聊天机器人解决方案，实时提供可解释的机器学习预测认知衰退。通过语言概念特征的分析，我们旨在减少模型偏见，提升其在临床诊断中的辅助作用。具体来说，我们的系统包括数据提取、流式数据处理、实时分类和解释性仪表板，分类准确率超过80%，精神衰退类的召回率达到85%。总之，我们提供了一个经济实惠、灵活、无创且个性化的诊断系统。

> Based on official estimates, 50 million people worldwide are affected by dementia, and this number increases by 10 million new patients every year. Without a cure, clinical prognostication and early intervention represent the most effective ways to delay its progression. To this end, Artificial Intelligence and computational linguistics can be exploited for natural language analysis, personalized assessment, monitoring, and treatment. However, traditional approaches need more semantic knowledge management and explicability capabilities. Moreover, using Large Language Models (LLMs) for cognitive decline diagnosis is still scarce, even though these models represent the most advanced way for clinical-patient communication using intelligent systems. Consequently, we leverage an LLM using the latest Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in a chatbot solution to provide interpretable Machine Learning prediction of cognitive decline in real-time. Linguistic-conceptual features are exploited for appropriate natural language analysis. Through explainability, we aim to fight potential biases of the models and improve their potential to help clinical workers in their diagnosis decisions. More in detail, the proposed pipeline is composed of (i) data extraction employing NLP-based prompt engineering; (ii) stream-based data processing including feature engineering, analysis, and selection; (iii) real-time classification; and (iv) the explainability dashboard to provide visual and natural language descriptions of the prediction outcome. Classification results exceed 80 % in all evaluation metrics, with a recall value for the mental deterioration class about 85 %. To sum up, we contribute with an affordable, flexible, non-invasive, personalized diagnostic system to this work.
