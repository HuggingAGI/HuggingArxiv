# 摘要

> FireRedTTS 是一个基础的文本到语音框架，旨在满足个性化和多样化语音生成应用的需求。它包括数据处理、基础系统和下游应用三部分。首先，我们展示了将原始音频转换为高质量 TTS 数据集的数据处理流程。接着，提出了一个基于语言模型的 TTS 系统，通过语义分词器将语音压缩为语义标记，并由语言模型生成。最后，通过两阶段波形生成器解码为高保真波形。该系统应用于配音语音克隆和聊天机器人语音生成。实验表明，FireRedTTS 能稳定合成高质量语音，并在不同场景下灵活适应。

> This work proposes FireRedTTS, a foundation text-to-speech framework, to meet the growing demands for personalized and diverse generative speech applications. The framework comprises three parts: data processing, foundation system, and downstream applications. First, we comprehensively present our data processing pipeline, which transforms massive raw audio into a large-scale high-quality TTS dataset with rich annotations and a wide coverage of content, speaking style, and timbre. Then, we propose a language-model-based foundation TTS system. The speech signal is compressed into discrete semantic tokens via a semantic-aware speech tokenizer, and can be generated by a language model from the prompt text and audio. Then, a two-stage waveform generator is proposed to decode them to the high-fidelity waveform. We present two applications of this system: voice cloning for dubbing and human-like speech generation for chatbots. The experimental results demonstrate the solid in-context learning capability of FireRedTTS, which can stably synthesize high-quality speech consistent with the prompt text and audio. For dubbing, FireRedTTS can clone target voices in a zero-shot way for the UGC scenario and adapt to studio-level expressive voice characters in the PUGC scenario via few-shot fine-tuning with 1-hour recording. Moreover, FireRedTTS achieves controllable human-like speech generation in a casual style with paralinguistic behaviors and emotions via instruction tuning, to better serve spoken chatbots.
