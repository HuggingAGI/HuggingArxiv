> Safety vs. Performance: How Multi-Objective Learning Reduces Barriers to Market Entry

# 摘要

> 新兴的 LLM 和 ML 模型市场似乎存在集中趋势，引发了关于市场进入壁垒的担忧。我们通过经济和算法视角，探讨了降低壁垒的现象。现有公司若模型不符安全目标，将面临声誉风险，而新公司则较易规避。我们构建了多目标高维回归框架，量化声誉损害，并分析新公司入市所需数据量。结果显示，多目标考量能大幅降低壁垒，所需数据远少于现有公司。此外，我们推导了多目标高维线性回归的缩放定律，揭示数据集大时缩放率减缓，这一发现颇具独立价值。

> Emerging marketplaces for large language models and other large-scale machine learning (ML) models appear to exhibit market concentration, which has raised concerns about whether there are insurmountable barriers to entry in such markets. In this work, we study this issue from both an economic and an algorithmic point of view, focusing on a phenomenon that reduces barriers to entry. Specifically, an incumbent company risks reputational damage unless its model is sufficiently aligned with safety objectives, whereas a new company can more easily avoid reputational damage. To study this issue formally, we define a multi-objective high-dimensional regression framework that captures reputational damage, and we characterize the number of data points that a new company needs to enter the market. Our results demonstrate how multi-objective considerations can fundamentally reduce barriers to entry -- the required number of data points can be significantly smaller than the incumbent company's dataset size. En route to proving these results, we develop scaling laws for high-dimensional linear regression in multi-objective environments, showing that the scaling rate becomes slower when the dataset size is large, which could be of independent interest.
