> LLM 凭借其卓越的文本处理能力，彻底改变了 AI 和机器学习领域。然而，其广泛应用也带来了显著的安全隐患。深度神经网络的固有漏洞与新兴威胁相结合，可能误导安全评估，制造虚假安全感。鉴于 LLM 安全研究的广泛进展，我们总结当前研究现状，旨在帮助研究者洞察现状，推动未来发展。本文综述了 LLM 的漏洞与威胁，评估了现有防御机制的有效性。通过分析最新的攻击手段与模型弱点，我们揭示了攻击机制的演变，并审视了当前防御策略的优劣。通过对比攻防进展，我们指出了研究空白，并提出了提升 LLM 安全性的未来方向。我们的目标是通过深化对 LLM 安全挑战的理解，推动更强大安全措施的开发。

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence and machine learning through their advanced text processing and generating capabilities. However, their widespread deployment has raised significant safety and reliability concerns. Established vulnerabilities in deep neural networks, coupled with emerging threat models, may compromise security evaluations and create a false sense of security. Given the extensive research in the field of LLM security, we believe that summarizing the current state of affairs will help the research community better understand the present landscape and inform future developments. This paper reviews current research on LLM vulnerabilities and threats, and evaluates the effectiveness of contemporary defense mechanisms. We analyze recent studies on attack vectors and model weaknesses, providing insights into attack mechanisms and the evolving threat landscape. We also examine current defense strategies, highlighting their strengths and limitations. By contrasting advancements in attack and defense methodologies, we identify research gaps and propose future directions to enhance LLM security. Our goal is to advance the understanding of LLM safety challenges and guide the development of more robust security measures.
