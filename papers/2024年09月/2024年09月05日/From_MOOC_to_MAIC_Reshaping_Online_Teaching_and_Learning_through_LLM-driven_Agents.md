> From MOOC to MAIC: Reshaping Online Teaching and Learning through LLM-driven Agents

# 摘要

> 自在线教育兴起以来，这种通过在线平台共享课程的方式迅速普及，引发了广泛讨论。尽管个性化学习仍有巨大潜力，但新AI技术的融入已催生出教育推荐和智能辅导等应用。随着大型语言模型（LLM）的智能涌现，教育增强得以在统一基础模型上深化整合。为此，我们推出MAIC（大规模AI赋能课程），利用LLM驱动的多代理系统打造AI增强课堂，兼顾扩展性与适应性。我们在清华大学开展初步实验，分析了500多名学生的10多万条学习记录，获得宝贵见解。未来，我们将构建一个开源平台，整合研究、技术与应用，共同探索大模型AI时代在线教育的无限可能。这个平台将成为教育者、研究者和创新者的协作中心，携手开创AI驱动在线教育的未来。

> Since the first instances of online education, where courses were uploaded to accessible and shared online platforms, this form of scaling the dissemination of human knowledge to reach a broader audience has sparked extensive discussion and widespread adoption. Recognizing that personalized learning still holds significant potential for improvement, new AI technologies have been continuously integrated into this learning format, resulting in a variety of educational AI applications such as educational recommendation and intelligent tutoring. The emergence of intelligence in large language models (LLMs) has allowed for these educational enhancements to be built upon a unified foundational model, enabling deeper integration. In this context, we propose MAIC (Massive AI-empowered Course), a new form of online education that leverages LLM-driven multi-agent systems to construct an AI-augmented classroom, balancing scalability with adaptivity. Beyond exploring the conceptual framework and technical innovations, we conduct preliminary experiments at Tsinghua University, one of China's leading universities. Drawing from over 100,000 learning records of more than 500 students, we obtain a series of valuable observations and initial analyses. This project will continue to evolve, ultimately aiming to establish a comprehensive open platform that supports and unifies research, technology, and applications in exploring the possibilities of online education in the era of large model AI. We envision this platform as a collaborative hub, bringing together educators, researchers, and innovators to collectively explore the future of AI-driven online education.
