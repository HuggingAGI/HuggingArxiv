> Identify Design Problems Through Questioning: Exploring Role-playing Interactions with Large Language Models to Foster Design Questioning Skills

# 摘要

> 识别设计问题是解决问题的关键，但对新手来说颇具挑战。提问是一项重要技能，能让学生独立发现问题，而非被动依赖教师。本研究通过与LLM驱动的对话代理进行角色扮演，旨在提升设计新手的提问能力。我们设计了一个LLM驱动的CA原型，并邀请16名新手参与实际设计课程，观察他们与CA的互动。结果显示，CA虽激发了提问并减轻了压力，但也导致了对LLM回答的过度依赖。为此，我们提出了改进建议和未来研究方向，以更好地培养学生的提问技能。

> Identifying design problems is a crucial step for creating plausible solutions, but it is challenging for design novices due to their limited knowledge and experience. Questioning is a promising skill that enables students to independently identify design problems without being passive or relying on instructors. This study explores role-playing interactions with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Conversational Agents (CAs) to foster the questioning skills of novice design students. We proposed an LLM-powered CA prototype and conducted a preliminary study with 16 novice design students engaged in a real-world design class to observe the interactions between students and the LLM-powered CAs. Our findings indicate that while the CAs stimulated questioning and reduced pressure to ask questions, it also inadvertently led to over-reliance on LLM responses. We proposed design considerations and future works for LLM-powered CA to foster questioning skills.
