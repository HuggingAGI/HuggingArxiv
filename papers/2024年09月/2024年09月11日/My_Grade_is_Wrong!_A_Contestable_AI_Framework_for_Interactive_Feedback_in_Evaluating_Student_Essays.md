> "My Grade is Wrong!": A Contestable AI Framework for Interactive Feedback in Evaluating Student Essays

# 摘要

> 互动反馈的双向流动比传统单向反馈更有效，但在教育实践中广泛应用时过于耗时。尽管大型语言模型 (LLM) 具备自动化反馈的潜力，但在互动环境中仍难以进行有效推理和互动。本文提出的 CAELF 框架，通过结合多代理系统和计算论证，实现了互动反馈的自动化。论文首先由多个 TA 代理评估，再由教师代理通过形式推理生成反馈和评分。学生可进一步与反馈互动，深化理解。案例研究显示，CAELF 显著提升了 LLM 的推理和互动能力，为解决教育环境中互动反馈的时间和资源障碍提供了新思路。

> Interactive feedback, where feedback flows in both directions between teacher and student, is more effective than traditional one-way feedback. However, it is often too time-consuming for widespread use in educational practice. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have potential for automating feedback, they struggle with reasoning and interaction in an interactive setting. This paper introduces CAELF, a Contestable AI Empowered LLM Framework for automating interactive feedback. CAELF allows students to query, challenge, and clarify their feedback by integrating a multi-agent system with computational argumentation. Essays are first assessed by multiple Teaching-Assistant Agents (TA Agents), and then a Teacher Agent aggregates the evaluations through formal reasoning to generate feedback and grades. Students can further engage with the feedback to refine their understanding. A case study on 500 critical thinking essays with user studies demonstrates that CAELF significantly improves interactive feedback, enhancing the reasoning and interaction capabilities of LLMs. This approach offers a promising solution to overcoming the time and resource barriers that have limited the adoption of interactive feedback in educational settings.
