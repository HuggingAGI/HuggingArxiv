# 摘要

> 本文推出 MVLLaVA，一个专为新颖视角合成设计的智能代理。它结合了多视角扩散模型与多模态模型 LLaVA，高效处理各类任务。MVLLaVA 是一个灵活的平台，能适应单张图像、描述性标题或视角变化指令等多种输入。我们设计了专门的指令模板来微调 LLaVA，使 MVLLaVA 能根据用户指令生成新视角图像，展现了其多任务适应性。实验证明，MVLLaVA 在处理多样视角合成挑战时表现出色，功能强大且灵活。

> This paper introduces MVLLaVA, an intelligent agent designed for novel view synthesis tasks. MVLLaVA integrates multiple multi-view diffusion models with a large multimodal model, LLaVA, enabling it to handle a wide range of tasks efficiently. MVLLaVA represents a versatile and unified platform that adapts to diverse input types, including a single image, a descriptive caption, or a specific change in viewing azimuth, guided by language instructions for viewpoint generation. We carefully craft task-specific instruction templates, which are subsequently used to fine-tune LLaVA. As a result, MVLLaVA acquires the capability to generate novel view images based on user instructions, demonstrating its flexibility across diverse tasks. Experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of MVLLaVA, demonstrating its robust performance and versatility in tackling diverse novel view synthesis challenges.
