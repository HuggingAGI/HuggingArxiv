> MRAC Track 1: 2nd Workshop on Multimodal, Generative and Responsible Affective Computing

# 摘要

> 随着多模态生成技术的迅猛发展，情感计算研究引发了关于情感智能AI系统潜在影响的讨论。情感计算涉及情感AI及相关技术的设计与实施，旨在提升人们的生活质量。设计情感计算模型需大量多模态数据，包括图像、视频、音频、文本和生理信号。此外，情感计算在各个阶段都需深入考虑伦理问题，从训练模型到实际应用。MRAC 2024 Track 1研讨会旨在将这些负责任的原则从实验室扩展到现实世界，强调负责任开发。研讨会还将探讨生成技术的潜在影响及其伦理问题，为研究人员和行业专业人士提供洞见。这是首个从负责任AI角度全面探讨多模态生成情感计算的研讨会系列，本次为第二次举办。网页：https://react-ws.github.io/2024/

> With the rapid advancements in multimodal generative technology, Affective Computing research has provoked discussion about the potential consequences of AI systems equipped with emotional intelligence. Affective Computing involves the design, evaluation, and implementation of Emotion AI and related technologies aimed at improving people's lives. Designing a computational model in affective computing requires vast amounts of multimodal data, including RGB images, video, audio, text, and physiological signals. Moreover, Affective Computing research is deeply engaged with ethical considerations at various stages-from training emotionally intelligent models on large-scale human data to deploying these models in specific applications. Fundamentally, the development of any AI system must prioritize its impact on humans, aiming to augment and enhance human abilities rather than replace them, while drawing inspiration from human intelligence in a safe and responsible manner. The MRAC 2024 Track 1 workshop seeks to extend these principles from controlled, small-scale lab environments to real-world, large-scale contexts, emphasizing responsible development. The workshop also aims to highlight the potential implications of generative technology, along with the ethical consequences of its use, to researchers and industry professionals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first workshop series to comprehensively address the full spectrum of multimodal, generative affective computing from a responsible AI perspective, and this is the second iteration of this workshop.
