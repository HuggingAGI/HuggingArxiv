> Interactive Speculative Planning: Enhance Agent Efficiency through Co-design of System and User Interface

# 摘要

> 代理作为以用户为中心的工具，正越来越多地用于任务委托，通过生成思想、与用户代理互动和制定行动计划来协助处理各种请求。然而，基于大型语言模型的代理常因底层模型的规模和高需求导致的效率限制，以及生成大量中间思想带来的结构复杂性，而面临显著的规划延迟。本文提出了一种以人为中心的交互式推测规划方法，旨在通过系统设计和人机交互提升代理规划效率。我们主张代理系统与用户界面的共同设计，强调系统需能流畅处理用户交互和打断。通过将人类打断融入系统，我们不仅使其更贴近用户需求，还通过人在回路中的交互加速过程，提供准确的中间步骤。代码和数据将公开发布。

> Agents, as user-centric tools, are increasingly deployed for human task delegation, assisting with a broad spectrum of requests by generating thoughts, engaging with user proxies, and producing action plans. However, agents based on large language models (LLMs) often face substantial planning latency due to two primary factors: the efficiency limitations of the underlying LLMs due to their large size and high demand, and the structural complexity of the agents due to the extensive generation of intermediate thoughts to produce the final output. Given that inefficiency in service provision can undermine the value of automation for users, this paper presents a human-centered efficient agent planning method -- Interactive Speculative Planning -- aiming at enhancing the efficiency of agent planning through both system design and human-AI interaction. Our approach advocates for the co-design of the agent system and user interface, underscoring the importance of an agent system that can fluidly manage user interactions and interruptions. By integrating human interruptions as a fundamental component of the system, we not only make it more user-centric but also expedite the entire process by leveraging human-in-the-loop interactions to provide accurate intermediate steps. Code and data will be released.
