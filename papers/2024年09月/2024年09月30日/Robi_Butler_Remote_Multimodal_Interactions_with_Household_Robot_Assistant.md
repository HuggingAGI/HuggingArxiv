# 摘要

> 本文介绍的 Robi Butler 是一款创新的家庭机器人，支持与远程用户的多模态互动。用户可以通过 Robi Butler 监控机器人状态、发送文本或语音指令，甚至用手势选择目标。系统核心是一个由 LLM 驱动的高级行为模块，能解析多模态指令并生成行动计划。这些计划基于 VLM 支持的开放词汇原语，处理文本和指向查询。Robi Butler 能以零-shot 方式在真实家庭环境中执行远程多模态指令。我们通过日常任务展示了其有效性和效率，并进行了用户研究，探讨多模态交互对远程人机互动效率和用户体验的影响及改进空间。

> In this paper, we introduce Robi Butler, a novel household robotic system that enables multimodal interactions with remote users. Building on the advanced communication interfaces, Robi Butler allows users to monitor the robot's status, send text or voice instructions, and select target objects by hand pointing. At the core of our system is a high-level behavior module, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), that interprets multimodal instructions to generate action plans. These plans are composed of a set of open vocabulary primitives supported by Vision Language Models (VLMs) that handle both text and pointing queries. The integration of the above components allows Robi Butler to ground remote multimodal instructions in the real-world home environment in a zero-shot manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of this system using a variety of daily household tasks that involve remote users giving multimodal instructions. Additionally, we conducted a user study to analyze how multimodal interactions affect efficiency and user experience during remote human-robot interaction and discuss the potential improvements.
