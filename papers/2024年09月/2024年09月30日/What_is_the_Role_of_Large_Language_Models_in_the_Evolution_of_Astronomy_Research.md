# 摘要

> ChatGPT 和顶尖的 LLM 正在快速革新多个领域，提供强大的应用工具。这些模型通过海量数据训练，展现出类人的文本生成能力，适用于创意、文献综述、编码、起草和推广等研究任务。我们邀请了 13 位不同背景的天文学家，进行了为期数月的 LLM 应用探索，并评估其在研究活动中的表现。同时，我们通过匿名调查收集了参与者对 LLM 的看法。详细分析任务尝试和调查结果后，我们展示了 LLM 的潜力与局限，并探讨了相关伦理问题。最终，我们建议研究人员应结合批判性思维和专业知识，使 LLM 成为科学探究的助手而非替代品。

> ChatGPT and other state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming multiple fields, offering powerful tools for a wide range of applications. These models, commonly trained on vast datasets, exhibit human-like text generation capabilities, making them useful for research tasks such as ideation, literature review, coding, drafting, and outreach. We conducted a study involving 13 astronomers at different career stages and research fields to explore LLM applications across diverse tasks over several months and to evaluate their performance in research-related activities. This work was accompanied by an anonymous survey assessing participants' experiences and attitudes towards LLMs. We provide a detailed analysis of the tasks attempted and the survey answers, along with specific output examples. Our findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs in supporting research while also addressing general and research-specific ethical considerations. We conclude with a series of recommendations, emphasizing the need for researchers to complement LLMs with critical thinking and domain expertise, ensuring these tools serve as aids rather than substitutes for rigorous scientific inquiry.
