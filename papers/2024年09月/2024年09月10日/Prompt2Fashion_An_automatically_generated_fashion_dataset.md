> Prompt2Fashion: An automatically generated fashion dataset

# 摘要

> 尽管语言和视觉生成模型不断进步，但仍缺少连接个性化时尚需求与AI设计的数据集，限制了定制化时尚的发展。我们利用生成模型，根据用户需求自动创建涵盖多种场合、风格和体型的时尚图像数据集。通过不同的大型语言模型（LLMs）和提示策略，我们提供高质量、细节丰富且符合用户需求的个性化服装，并通过定性分析验证。目前，生成的服装由非专家评估，但我们强调专家知识在评估艺术性AI生成数据集中的重要性。我们的数据集已在GitHub公开，链接为https://github.com/georgiarg/Prompt2Fashion。

> Despite the rapid evolution and increasing efficacy of language and vision generative models, there remains a lack of comprehensive datasets that bridge the gap between personalized fashion needs and AI-driven design, limiting the potential for truly inclusive and customized fashion solutions. In this work, we leverage generative models to automatically construct a fashion image dataset tailored to various occasions, styles, and body types as instructed by users. We use different Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompting strategies to offer personalized outfits of high aesthetic quality, detail, and relevance to both expert and non-expert users' requirements, as demonstrated by qualitative analysis. Up until now the evaluation of the generated outfits has been conducted by non-expert human subjects. Despite the provided fine-grained insights on the quality and relevance of generation, we extend the discussion on the importance of expert knowledge for the evaluation of artistic AI-generated datasets such as this one. Our dataset is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/georgiarg/Prompt2Fashion.
