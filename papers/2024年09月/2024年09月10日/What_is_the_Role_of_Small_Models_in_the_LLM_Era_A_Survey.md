> What is the Role of Small Models in the LLM Era: A Survey

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLM）如 GPT-4 和 LLaMA-405B 在推动 AGI 方面取得了巨大进展，但其庞大的规模导致高昂的计算成本和能源消耗，使得资源有限的研究者和企业难以承受。与此同时，小型模型（SM）虽常被低估，却在实际应用中扮演重要角色。本文从合作与竞争两个角度，系统探讨了 LLM 与 SM 的关系，旨在为从业者提供洞见，深化对小型模型价值的认识，并推动计算资源的更高效利用。代码已开源，详见 https://github.com/tigerchen52/role_of_small_models。

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in advancing artificial general intelligence (AGI), leading to the development of increasingly large models such as GPT-4 and LLaMA-405B. However, scaling up model sizes results in exponentially higher computational costs and energy consumption, making these models impractical for academic researchers and businesses with limited resources. At the same time, Small Models (SMs) are frequently used in practical settings, although their significance is currently underestimated. This raises important questions about the role of small models in the era of LLMs, a topic that has received limited attention in prior research. In this work, we systematically examine the relationship between LLMs and SMs from two key perspectives: Collaboration and Competition. We hope this survey provides valuable insights for practitioners, fostering a deeper understanding of the contribution of small models and promoting more efficient use of computational resources.
