# 摘要

> 在自动驾驶汽车上路前，生成角案例的测试变得愈发关键。然而，现有方法难以满足多样化的测试需求，且缺乏对未知情况的适应能力，导致生成场景的便利性和实用性大打折扣。为此，我们推出了 OmniTester：一个基于多模态大型语言模型的框架，充分利用了 LLM 的广泛知识和推理能力，旨在模拟环境中生成真实且多样的测试场景。除了提示工程，我们还引入了城市交通模拟工具，简化了 LLM 生成代码的复杂性。同时，通过检索增强生成和自我改进机制，我们提升了 LLM 对场景的理解，使其能生成更逼真的场景。实验证明，OmniTester 在生成三种复杂场景时表现出色，且能有效重建事故报告中的新场景，展现了 LLM 的强大泛化能力。

> The generation of corner cases has become increasingly crucial for efficiently testing autonomous vehicles prior to road deployment. However, existing methods struggle to accommodate diverse testing requirements and often lack the ability to generalize to unseen situations, thereby reducing the convenience and usability of the generated scenarios. A method that facilitates easily controllable scenario generation for efficient autonomous vehicles (AV) testing with realistic and challenging situations is greatly needed. To address this, we proposed OmniTester: a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) based framework that fully leverages the extensive world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. OmniTester is designed to generate realistic and diverse scenarios within a simulation environment, offering a robust solution for testing and evaluating AVs. In addition to prompt engineering, we employ tools from Simulation of Urban Mobility to simplify the complexity of codes generated by LLMs. Furthermore, we incorporate Retrieval-Augmented Generation and a self-improvement mechanism to enhance the LLM's understanding of scenarios, thereby increasing its ability to produce more realistic scenes. In the experiments, we demonstrated the controllability and realism of our approaches in generating three types of challenging and complex scenarios. Additionally, we showcased its effectiveness in reconstructing new scenarios described in crash report, driven by the generalization capability of LLMs.
