> User Preferences for Large Language Model versus Template-Based Explanations of Movie Recommendations: A Pilot Study

# 摘要

> 推荐系统已深入我们的数字生活，但它们背后的推荐逻辑往往对用户不透明。虽然有些系统通过图结构展示推荐路径，但非专家难以理解。常见的替代方案是将图解释转换为基于模板的文本解释，但这些解释有时显得生硬。我们提出了一种新方法，即利用大型语言模型（LLM）生成“基于LLM”的解释。为评估其效果，我们进行了试点研究，25名参与者分别体验了三种解释：传统模板解释、LLM重述模板解释和纯LLM解释。初步结果显示，基于LLM的解释可能带来更丰富、更吸引人的用户体验，更符合用户期望。这项研究不仅揭示了现有解释方法的局限，还为提升推荐系统用户满意度和信任度提供了新方向。

> Recommender systems have become integral to our digital experiences, from online shopping to streaming platforms. Still, the rationale behind their suggestions often remains opaque to users. While some systems employ a graph-based approach, offering inherent explainability through paths associating recommended items and seed items, non-experts could not easily understand these explanations. A popular alternative is to convert graph-based explanations into textual ones using a template and an algorithm, which we denote here as ''template-based'' explanations. Yet, these can sometimes come across as impersonal or uninspiring. A novel method would be to employ large language models (LLMs) for this purpose, which we denote as ''LLM-based''. To assess the effectiveness of LLMs in generating more resonant explanations, we conducted a pilot study with 25 participants. They were presented with three explanations: (1) traditional template-based, (2) LLM-based rephrasing of the template output, and (3) purely LLM-based explanations derived from the graph-based explanations. Although subject to high variance, preliminary findings suggest that LLM-based explanations may provide a richer and more engaging user experience, further aligning with user expectations. This study sheds light on the potential limitations of current explanation methods and offers promising directions for leveraging large language models to improve user satisfaction and trust in recommender systems.
