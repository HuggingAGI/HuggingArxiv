> "It Explains What I am Currently Going Through Perfectly to a Tee": Understanding User Perceptions on LLM-Enhanced Narrative Interventions

# 摘要

> 我们利用大型语言模型 (LLM) 创作了能够应对个人独特挑战的定制故事，这些故事不仅更具共鸣，还能有效传达心理学理论。研究表明，LLM 生成的故事在传达核心信息、促进反思和减少负面信念方面，效果优于人类创作的故事。这些故事不仅更具相关性，而且在真实性上与人类创作的故事不相上下，显示出 LLM 在帮助年轻人应对挑战方面的巨大潜力。未来，基于叙事的数字心理健康干预应注重保持故事的相关性，同时避免不切实际，并优化 AI 生成内容的语言和语气。

> Stories about overcoming personal struggles can effectively illustrate the application of psychological theories in real life, yet they may fail to resonate with individuals' experiences. In this work, we employ large language models (LLMs) to create tailored narratives that acknowledge and address unique challenging thoughts and situations faced by individuals. Our study, involving 346 young adults across two settings, demonstrates that LLM-enhanced stories were perceived to be better than human-written ones in conveying key takeaways, promoting reflection, and reducing belief in negative thoughts. These stories were not only seen as more relatable but also similarly authentic to human-written ones, highlighting the potential of LLMs in helping young adults manage their struggles. The findings of this work provide crucial design considerations for future narrative-based digital mental health interventions, such as the need to maintain relatability without veering into implausibility and refining the wording and tone of AI-enhanced content.
