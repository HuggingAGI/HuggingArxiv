# 摘要

> 许多在线服务的隐私政策冗长复杂，导致用户大多选择不读，从而在不知情的情况下被收集数据。为此，我们尝试通过总结、自动注释或提供问答界面等方式，使隐私政策更易懂。借助大型语言模型（LLM）的进步，我们开发了更有效的工具来解析这些政策，帮助用户做出明智选择。本文提出了一种基于蕴含驱动的LLM框架，能将隐私政策段落分类为易懂的标签，其效果优于传统方法，平均F1分数提升11.2%，且预测结果具有高度的可解释性。

> While many online services provide privacy policies for end users to read and understand what personal data are being collected, these documents are often lengthy and complicated. As a result, the vast majority of users do not read them at all, leading to data collection under uninformed consent. Several attempts have been made to make privacy policies more user friendly by summarising them, providing automatic annotations or labels for key sections, or by offering chat interfaces to ask specific questions. With recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), there is an opportunity to develop more effective tools to parse privacy policies and help users make informed decisions. In this paper, we propose an entailment-driven LLM based framework to classify paragraphs of privacy policies into meaningful labels that are easily understood by users. The results demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional LLM methods, improving the F1 score in average by 11.2%. Additionally, our framework provides inherently explainable and meaningful predictions.
