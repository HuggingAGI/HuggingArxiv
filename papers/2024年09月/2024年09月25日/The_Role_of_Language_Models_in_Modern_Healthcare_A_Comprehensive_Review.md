> The Role of Language Models in Modern Healthcare: A Comprehensive Review

# 摘要

> LLM 在医疗保健中的应用因其处理复杂医疗数据和辅助临床决策的能力而备受瞩目。这些模型在理解和生成自然语言方面表现出色，对医疗记录、诊断和患者互动至关重要。本文回顾了语言模型从早期到现今最先进的发展历程，强调了其在医疗领域的优势，并探讨了数据隐私、偏见和伦理等挑战。同时，本文还探讨了 LLM 提升医疗服务的潜力，以及确保其伦理和有效融入医疗实践的关键步骤。

> The application of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare has gained significant attention due to their ability to process complex medical data and provide insights for clinical decision-making. These models have demonstrated substantial capabilities in understanding and generating natural language, which is crucial for medical documentation, diagnostics, and patient interaction. This review examines the trajectory of language models from their early stages to the current state-of-the-art LLMs, highlighting their strengths in healthcare applications and discussing challenges such as data privacy, bias, and ethical considerations. The potential of LLMs to enhance healthcare delivery is explored, alongside the necessary steps to ensure their ethical and effective integration into medical practice.
