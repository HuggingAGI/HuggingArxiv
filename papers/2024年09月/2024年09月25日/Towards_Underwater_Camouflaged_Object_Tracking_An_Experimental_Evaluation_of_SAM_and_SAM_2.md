> Towards Underwater Camouflaged Object Tracking: An Experimental Evaluation of SAM and SAM 2

# 摘要

> 过去十年，视觉对象跟踪因大规模数据集的涌现而飞速发展。然而，现有数据集多聚焦于露天场景，严重制约了水下跟踪技术的发展。为此，我们推出了首个大规模水下伪装对象跟踪数据集UW-COT。基于此，本文评估了多种先进跟踪方法及最新分割技术的性能，特别是在水下环境中对比了SAM与SAM 2的表现。结果显示，SAM 2在处理水下伪装对象时表现更佳，显著优于现有先进方法。这为水下跟踪技术的提升提供了重要参考。数据集链接：\color{magenta}{https://github.com/983632847/Awesome-Multimodal-Object-Tracking}。

> Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in visual object tracking, largely due to the availability of large-scale training datasets. However, existing tracking datasets are primarily focused on open-air scenarios, which greatly limits the development of object tracking in underwater environments. To address this issue, we take a step forward by proposing the first large-scale underwater camouflaged object tracking dataset, namely UW-COT. Based on the proposed dataset, this paper presents an experimental evaluation of several advanced visual object tracking methods and the latest advancements in image and video segmentation. Specifically, we compare the performance of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its updated version, SAM 2, in challenging underwater environments. Our findings highlight the improvements in SAM 2 over SAM, demonstrating its enhanced capability to handle the complexities of underwater camouflaged objects. Compared to current advanced visual object tracking methods, the latest video segmentation foundation model SAM 2 also exhibits significant advantages, providing valuable insights into the development of more effective tracking technologies for underwater scenarios.
