> Ethical and Scalable Automation: A Governance and Compliance Framework for Business Applications

# 摘要

> AI在商业中的广泛应用带来了伦理、治理和法律合规的重大挑战。尽管企业已将AI融入日常运营，但缺乏统一的风险缓解策略。本文提出一个框架，确保AI伦理、可控、可行且理想。通过平衡这些因素，框架解决了性能与可解释性等权衡问题。该框架为金融和医疗等行业提供了实用指导，帮助企业满足GPDR和欧盟AI法案等标准。案例研究显示，大型语言模型在生成环境问题合成意见方面具有成本效益。这些研究证明，结构化框架能提升透明度并保持性能。未来研究应进一步验证该框架在不同工业环境中的适用性，确保其可扩展性和适应性。

> The popularisation of applying AI in businesses poses significant challenges relating to ethical principles, governance, and legal compliance. Although businesses have embedded AI into their day-to-day processes, they lack a unified approach for mitigating its potential risks. This paper introduces a framework ensuring that AI must be ethical, controllable, viable, and desirable. Balancing these factors ensures the design of a framework that addresses its trade-offs, such as balancing performance against explainability. A successful framework provides practical advice for businesses to meet regulatory requirements in sectors such as finance and healthcare, where it is critical to comply with standards like GPDR and the EU AI Act. Different case studies validate this framework by integrating AI in both academic and practical environments. For instance, large language models are cost-effective alternatives for generating synthetic opinions that emulate attitudes to environmental issues. These case studies demonstrate how having a structured framework could enhance transparency and maintain performance levels as shown from the alignment between synthetic and expected distributions. This alignment is quantified using metrics like Chi-test scores, normalized mutual information, and Jaccard indexes. Future research should explore the framework's empirical validation in diverse industrial settings further, ensuring the model's scalability and adaptability.
