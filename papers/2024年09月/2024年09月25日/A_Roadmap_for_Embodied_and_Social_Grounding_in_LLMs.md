> A Roadmap for Embodied and Social Grounding in LLMs

# 摘要

> LLM 与机器人系统的结合，不仅提升了通信能力，还增强了多模态处理、高级推理和计划生成等技能。然而，仅靠多模态连接或机器人身体，LLM 仍难以真正理解语言。借鉴人类经验，我们提出三个关键元素：主动身体系统作为环境体验的基石，时间结构化的互动以实现自我与外界的连贯交流，以及社交技能以共享共同体验。这些元素共同构成了 LLM 在机器人领域的基础。

> The fusion of Large Language Models (LLMs) and robotic systems has led to a transformative paradigm in the robotic field, offering unparalleled capabilities not only in the communication domain but also in skills like multimodal input handling, high-level reasoning, and plan generation. The grounding of LLMs knowledge into the empirical world has been considered a crucial pathway to exploit the efficiency of LLMs in robotics. Nevertheless, connecting LLMs' representations to the external world with multimodal approaches or with robots' bodies is not enough to let them understand the meaning of the language they are manipulating. Taking inspiration from humans, this work draws attention to three necessary elements for an agent to grasp and experience the world. The roadmap for LLMs grounding is envisaged in an active bodily system as the reference point for experiencing the environment, a temporally structured experience for a coherent, self-related interaction with the external world, and social skills to acquire a common-grounded shared experience.
