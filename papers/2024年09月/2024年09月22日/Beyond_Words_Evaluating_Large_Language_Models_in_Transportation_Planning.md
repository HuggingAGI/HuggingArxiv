# 摘要

> 2023年，生成式人工智能（GenAI）的复兴和快速发展在城市交通和物流等多个行业领域引发了变革性转变。本研究聚焦于GPT-4和Phi-3-mini这两款大型语言模型（LLMs），旨在通过一个包含地理空间技能、交通领域技能和现实世界交通问题解决的评估框架，提升交通规划的效率。研究结果显示，GPT-4在GIS和交通特定任务中表现出色，显示出其在交通规划中的巨大潜力。而Phi-3-mini虽然在特定分析场景中表现不俗，但在资源受限环境中更具优势。这些发现不仅突显了GenAI技术在城市交通规划中的变革潜力，也为未来探索更先进的LLMs和RAG技术在交通管理中的应用提供了方向。

> The resurgence and rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in 2023 has catalyzed transformative shifts across numerous industry sectors, including urban transportation and logistics. This study investigates the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4 and Phi-3-mini, to enhance transportation planning. The study assesses the performance and spatial comprehension of these models through a transportation-informed evaluation framework that includes general geospatial skills, general transportation domain skills, and real-world transportation problem-solving. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, the research encompasses an evaluation of the LLMs' general Geographic Information System (GIS) skills, general transportation domain knowledge as well as abilities to support human decision-making in the real-world transportation planning scenarios of congestion pricing. Results indicate that GPT-4 demonstrates superior accuracy and reliability across various GIS and transportation-specific tasks compared to Phi-3-mini, highlighting its potential as a robust tool for transportation planners. Nonetheless, Phi-3-mini exhibits competence in specific analytical scenarios, suggesting its utility in resource-constrained environments. The findings underscore the transformative potential of GenAI technologies in urban transportation planning. Future work could explore the application of newer LLMs and the impact of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, on a broader set of real-world transportation planning and operations challenges, to deepen the integration of advanced AI models in transportation management practices.
