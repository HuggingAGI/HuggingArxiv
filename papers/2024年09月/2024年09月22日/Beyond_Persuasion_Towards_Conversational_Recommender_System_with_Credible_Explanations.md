> Beyond Persuasion: Towards Conversational Recommender System with Credible Explanations

# 摘要

> 借助大型语言模型，对话推荐系统 (CRS) 已经具备了强大的说服力，但它们可能在解释中掺杂不可信信息，从而损害用户信任。为此，我们提出了 PC-CRS 方法，通过可信度感知策略指导解释生成，并借助事后反思逐步优化，以提升解释的可信度。实验表明，PC-CRS 能有效生成既说服力强又可信的解释。深入分析还揭示了当前方法产生不可信解释的原因，以及可信解释提升推荐准确性的潜力。

> With the aid of large language models, current conversational recommender system (CRS) has gaining strong abilities to persuade users to accept recommended items. While these CRSs are highly persuasive, they can mislead users by incorporating incredible information in their explanations, ultimately damaging the long-term trust between users and the CRS. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method, called PC-CRS, to enhance the credibility of CRS's explanations during persuasion. It guides the explanation generation through our proposed credibility-aware persuasive strategies and then gradually refines explanations via post-hoc self-reflection. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of PC-CRS in promoting persuasive and credible explanations. Further analysis reveals the reason behind current methods producing incredible explanations and the potential of credible explanations to improve recommendation accuracy.
