> 3D-CT-GPT: Generating 3D Radiology Reports through Integration of Large Vision-Language Models

# 摘要

> 在现代放射诊断中，医学图像分析尤为关键，尤其是在医学影像数据激增的背景下。自动化报告生成系统的需求日益迫切。尽管先前研究多聚焦于2D医学图像的机器学习和多模态语言模型，但3D医学图像的报告生成因数据稀缺和计算复杂性而较少涉足。本文推出的3D-CT-GPT，是一款基于视觉问答的医学视觉语言模型，专为3D CT扫描（尤其是胸部CT）生成放射学报告。实验显示，3D-CT-GPT在报告准确性和质量上显著超越现有方法。尽管现有方法如CT2Rep和M3D有限，我们通过合理的数据转换和评估确保了公平比较。实验证明，3D-CT-GPT不仅提升诊断准确性，还增强报告连贯性，成为临床报告生成的坚实选择。未来，我们将扩展数据集并优化模型，以进一步提升其性能和应用广度。

> Medical image analysis is crucial in modern radiological diagnostics, especially given the exponential growth in medical imaging data. The demand for automated report generation systems has become increasingly urgent. While prior research has mainly focused on using machine learning and multimodal language models for 2D medical images, the generation of reports for 3D medical images has been less explored due to data scarcity and computational complexities. This paper introduces 3D-CT-GPT, a Visual Question Answering (VQA)-based medical visual language model specifically designed for generating radiology reports from 3D CT scans, particularly chest CTs. Extensive experiments on both public and private datasets demonstrate that 3D-CT-GPT significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of report accuracy and quality. Although current methods are few, including the partially open-source CT2Rep and the open-source M3D, we ensured fair comparison through appropriate data conversion and evaluation methodologies. Experimental results indicate that 3D-CT-GPT enhances diagnostic accuracy and report coherence, establishing itself as a robust solution for clinical radiology report generation. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset and further optimizing the model to enhance its performance and applicability.
