> GP-GPT: Large Language Model for Gene-Phenotype Mapping

# 摘要

> 预训练的LLMs在生物医学领域备受瞩目，但多源基因组数据的复杂性给其应用带来了挑战。为此，我们推出了GP-GPT，首个专注于遗传表型知识表示和基因组关系分析的LLM。GP-GPT在包含300万术语的综合语料库上进行了两阶段微调，涵盖基因组学、蛋白质组学和医学遗传学。它在医学遗传信息检索和基因组分析任务中表现出色，超越了Llama2、Llama3和GPT-4等顶尖LLMs。GP-GPT不仅提升了遗传疾病关系研究，还促进了基因组学和医学遗传学领域的精准高效分析。研究还揭示了GP-GPT在生物因子实体表示上的细微变化，为LLMs在基因-表型研究中的应用开辟了新路径。

> Pre-trained large language models(LLMs) have attracted increasing attention in biomedical domains due to their success in natural language processing. However, the complex traits and heterogeneity of multi-sources genomics data pose significant challenges when adapting these models to the bioinformatics and biomedical field. To address these challenges, we present GP-GPT, the first specialized large language model for genetic-phenotype knowledge representation and genomics relation analysis. Our model is fine-tuned in two stages on a comprehensive corpus composed of over 3,000,000 terms in genomics, proteomics, and medical genetics, derived from multiple large-scale validated datasets and scientific publications. GP-GPT demonstrates proficiency in accurately retrieving medical genetics information and performing common genomics analysis tasks, such as genomics information retrieval and relationship determination. Comparative experiments across domain-specific tasks reveal that GP-GPT outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs, including Llama2, Llama3 and GPT-4. These results highlight GP-GPT's potential to enhance genetic disease relation research and facilitate accurate and efficient analysis in the fields of genomics and medical genetics. Our investigation demonstrated the subtle changes of bio-factor entities' representations in the GP-GPT, which suggested the opportunities for the application of LLMs to advancing gene-phenotype research.
