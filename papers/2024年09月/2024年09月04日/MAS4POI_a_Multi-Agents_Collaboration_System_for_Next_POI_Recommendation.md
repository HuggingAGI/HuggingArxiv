> MAS4POI: a Multi-Agents Collaboration System for Next POI Recommendation

# 摘要

> 基于LLM的多代理系统在复杂决策任务中潜力巨大，但在POI推荐领域的应用尚待深入。本文推出的MAS4POI系统，通过多代理协作，显著提升POI推荐效果。系统整合了DataAgent、Manager、Analyst和Navigator等专业LLM，各司其职，共同优化推荐流程。我们通过六个LLM和两个真实数据集的测试，验证了其在实际应用中的推荐准确性提升。代码已公开，详见https://github.com/yuqian2003/MAS4POI。

> LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems have potential benefits of complex decision-making tasks management across various domains but their applications in the next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation remain underexplored. This paper proposes a novel MAS4POI system designed to enhance next POI recommendations through multi-agent interactions. MAS4POI supports Large Language Models (LLMs) specializing in distinct agents such as DataAgent, Manager, Analyst, and Navigator with each contributes to a collaborative process of generating the next POI recommendations.The system is examined by integrating six distinct LLMs and evaluated by two real-world datasets for recommendation accuracy improvement in real-world scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/yuqian2003/MAS4POI.
