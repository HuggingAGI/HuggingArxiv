> A Comparative Study of Offline Models and Online LLMs in Fake News Detection

# 摘要

> 在快速变化的数字时代，假新闻检测仍是一大难题，错误信息传播速度前所未有。传统模型依赖静态数据和辅助信息，难以适应实时变化。而大型语言模型（LLM）凭借其丰富的预训练知识和独立分析文本的能力，展现出应对这一挑战的巨大潜力。然而，许多基于 LLM 的方法仍局限于静态数据，实时处理能力有待深入探索。本文系统评估了传统离线模型与最先进的 LLM 在实时假新闻检测中的表现，揭示了现有离线模型的局限性，并证明如 GPT-4、Claude 和 Gemini 等具备在线能力的 LLM 模型在实时检测中更具优势。研究强调了从离线向在线 LLM 模型过渡的重要性，以提升实时检测能力。同时，LLM 的普及使其更具可扩展性，并使打击假新闻的工具更加民主化。通过利用实时数据，我们的研究为构建更灵活、高效和可扩展的假新闻检测系统奠定了基础。

> Fake news detection remains a critical challenge in today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, where misinformation can spread faster than ever before. Traditional fake news detection models often rely on static datasets and auxiliary information, such as metadata or social media interactions, which limits their adaptability to real-time scenarios. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in addressing these challenges due to their extensive pre-trained knowledge and ability to analyze textual content without relying on auxiliary data. However, many of these LLM-based approaches are still rooted in static datasets, with limited exploration into their real-time processing capabilities. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of both traditional offline models and state-of-the-art LLMs for real-time fake news detection. We demonstrate the limitations of existing offline models, including their inability to adapt to dynamic misinformation patterns. Furthermore, we show that newer LLM models with online capabilities, such as GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini, are better suited for detecting emerging fake news in real-time contexts. Our findings emphasize the importance of transitioning from offline to online LLM models for real-time fake news detection. Additionally, the public accessibility of LLMs enhances their scalability and democratizes the tools needed to combat misinformation. By leveraging real-time data, our work marks a significant step toward more adaptive, effective, and scalable fake news detection systems.
