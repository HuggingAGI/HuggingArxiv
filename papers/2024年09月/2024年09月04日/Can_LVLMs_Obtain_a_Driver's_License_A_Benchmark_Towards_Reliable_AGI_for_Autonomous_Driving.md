> Can LVLMs Obtain a Driver's License? A Benchmark Towards Reliable AGI for Autonomous Driving

# 摘要

> 近期，大型视觉-语言模型（LVLMs）备受瞩目，众多研究致力于利用其广泛知识提升自动驾驶系统的解释性与稳健性。但这些模型多基于通用大数据集，缺乏专业驾驶所需的专业知识。现有视觉-语言驾驶数据集侧重于场景解读与决策，未明确涵盖交通规则与驾驶技巧，这些对行车安全至关重要。为此，我们推出了IDKB，一个包含百万级数据项的庞大数据集，涵盖多国驾驶手册、理论与模拟路考数据，全面覆盖从理论到实践的驾驶所需知识。我们利用IDKB对15个LVLMs进行了详尽测试，评估其在自动驾驶领域的可靠性，并进行了深入分析。同时，对主流模型进行微调，显著提升了性能，充分证明了我们数据集的价值。项目详情请访问：\url{https://4dvlab.github.io/project_page/idkb.html}

> Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently garnered significant attention, with many efforts aimed at harnessing their general knowledge to enhance the interpretability and robustness of autonomous driving models. However, LVLMs typically rely on large, general-purpose datasets and lack the specialized expertise required for professional and safe driving. Existing vision-language driving datasets focus primarily on scene understanding and decision-making, without providing explicit guidance on traffic rules and driving skills, which are critical aspects directly related to driving safety. To bridge this gap, we propose IDKB, a large-scale dataset containing over one million data items collected from various countries, including driving handbooks, theory test data, and simulated road test data. Much like the process of obtaining a driver's license, IDKB encompasses nearly all the explicit knowledge needed for driving from theory to practice. In particular, we conducted comprehensive tests on 15 LVLMs using IDKB to assess their reliability in the context of autonomous driving and provided extensive analysis. We also fine-tuned popular models, achieving notable performance improvements, which further validate the significance of our dataset.
