> Creating a Gen-AI based Track and Trace Assistant MVP (SuperTracy) for PostNL

# 摘要

> 生成AI的进步为公司开辟了新机遇，如提升客户服务效率和任务自动化。荷兰领先的包裹与电商企业PostNL计划运用生成AI优化包裹追踪的沟通体验。实习期间，我们打造了一款最小可行产品（MVP），旨在展示生成AI技术在包裹追踪、旅程分析及简化沟通方面的价值。我们的核心目标在于构建一个基于LLM的内部系统，降低对外部平台的依赖，并验证公司内部设立专门生成AI团队的可行性。该多代理LLM系统，即SuperTracy，能够自主应对多样化的用户咨询，优化内部知识管理。评估结果显示，SuperTracy在包裹追踪沟通方面的表现超乎预期，彰显了AI解决方案在物流领域的巨大潜力，预示着PostNL运营体系内进一步优化与拓展的广阔前景。

> The developments in the field of generative AI has brought a lot of opportunities for companies, for instance to improve efficiency in customer service and automating tasks. PostNL, the biggest parcel and E-commerce corporation of the Netherlands wants to use generative AI to enhance the communication around track and trace of parcels. During the internship a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) is created to showcase the value of using generative AI technologies, to enhance parcel tracking, analyzing the parcel's journey and being able to communicate about it in an easy to understand manner. The primary goal was to develop an in-house LLM-based system, reducing dependency on external platforms and establishing the feasibility of a dedicated generative AI team within the company. This multi-agent LLM based system aimed to construct parcel journey stories and identify logistical disruptions with heightened efficiency and accuracy. The research involved deploying a sophisticated AI-driven communication system, employing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced response precision, and optimizing large language models (LLMs) tailored to domain specific tasks.
  The MVP successfully implemented a multi-agent open-source LLM system, called SuperTracy. SuperTracy is capable of autonomously managing a broad spectrum of user inquiries and improving internal knowledge handling. Results and evaluation demonstrated technological innovation and feasibility, notably in communication about the track and trace of a parcel, which exceeded initial expectations. These advancements highlight the potential of AI-driven solutions in logistics, suggesting many opportunities for further refinement and broader implementation within PostNL operational framework.
