> Surveying the MLLM Landscape: A Meta-Review of Current Surveys

# 摘要

> 多模态大型语言模型 (MLLM) 的崛起，正深刻改变着人工智能领域，让机器能够自如地处理和生成跨文本、图像、音频和视频的内容。相较于传统的单模态系统，MLLM 展现了显著的进步，为自主代理、医疗诊断等多样应用开辟了新天地。通过融合多模态信息，MLLM 更全面地理解世界，更贴近人类感知。随着其能力不断增强，全面而精准的性能评估变得尤为重要。本调查系统梳理了 MLLM 的基准测试与评估方法，涵盖基础概念、应用场景、评估手段、伦理考量、安全保障、效率优化及特定领域应用等关键议题。我们深入分析现有文献，总结各家之长，进行细致比较，并探讨其在学术界的影响。同时，我们洞察新兴趋势，挖掘研究空白，为未来探索指明方向。本调查旨在为研究者和实践者提供 MLLM 评估的全景图，助力这一前沿领域持续突破。

> The rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has become a transformative force in the field of artificial intelligence, enabling machines to process and generate content across multiple modalities, such as text, images, audio, and video. These models represent a significant advancement over traditional unimodal systems, opening new frontiers in diverse applications ranging from autonomous agents to medical diagnostics. By integrating multiple modalities, MLLMs achieve a more holistic understanding of information, closely mimicking human perception. As the capabilities of MLLMs expand, the need for comprehensive and accurate performance evaluation has become increasingly critical. This survey aims to provide a systematic review of benchmark tests and evaluation methods for MLLMs, covering key topics such as foundational concepts, applications, evaluation methodologies, ethical concerns, security, efficiency, and domain-specific applications. Through the classification and analysis of existing literature, we summarize the main contributions and methodologies of various surveys, conduct a detailed comparative analysis, and examine their impact within the academic community. Additionally, we identify emerging trends and underexplored areas in MLLM research, proposing potential directions for future studies. This survey is intended to offer researchers and practitioners a comprehensive understanding of the current state of MLLM evaluation, thereby facilitating further progress in this rapidly evolving field.
