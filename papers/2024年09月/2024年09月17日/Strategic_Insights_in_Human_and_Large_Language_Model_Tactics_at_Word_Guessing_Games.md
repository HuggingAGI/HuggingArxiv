# 摘要

> 2022年初，一款简单的猜词游戏席卷全球，并迅速被改编成多种语言。本文深入分析了两年多来玩家策略的演变，通过调查25%的活跃玩家，揭示了他们的游戏策略和持续参与的动力。同时，我们评估了几种热门的开源和开放访问大型语言模型在两种语言中理解和玩这款游戏的能力。结果显示，部分模型在保持猜测准确性和避免重复方面表现不佳，甚至出现了生成虚构词汇和词形变化的错误。

> At the beginning of 2022, a simplistic word-guessing game took the world by storm and was further adapted to many languages beyond the original English version. In this paper, we examine the strategies of daily word-guessing game players that have evolved during a period of over two years. A survey gathered from 25% of frequent players reveals their strategies and motivations for continuing the daily journey. We also explore the capability of several popular open-access large language model systems and open-source models at comprehending and playing the game in two different languages. Results highlight the struggles of certain models to maintain correct guess length and generate repetitions, as well as hallucinations of non-existent words and inflections.
