> Combating Phone Scams with LLM-based Detection: Where Do We Stand?

# 摘要

> 电话诈骗严重威胁个人和社区，带来巨大经济损失和情感创伤。尽管持续打击，诈骗手段不断升级，迫切需要创新对策。本研究探索了大型语言模型 (LLM) 在检测欺诈电话中的潜力。通过分析对话动态，LLM 检测器能在诈骗发生时立即识别，提供即时保护。虽然前景看好，但偏见数据集、低召回率和幻觉等问题仍需解决，以推动该领域进一步发展。

> Phone scams pose a significant threat to individuals and communities, causing substantial financial losses and emotional distress. Despite ongoing efforts to combat these scams, scammers continue to adapt and refine their tactics, making it imperative to explore innovative countermeasures. This research explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to provide detection of fraudulent phone calls. By analyzing the conversational dynamics between scammers and victims, LLM-based detectors can identify potential scams as they occur, offering immediate protection to users. While such approaches demonstrate promising results, we also acknowledge the challenges of biased datasets, relatively low recall, and hallucinations that must be addressed for further advancement in this field
