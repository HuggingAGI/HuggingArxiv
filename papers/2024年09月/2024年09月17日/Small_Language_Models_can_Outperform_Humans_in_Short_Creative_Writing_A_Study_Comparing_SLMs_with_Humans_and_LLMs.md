> Small Language Models can Outperform Humans in Short Creative Writing: A Study Comparing SLMs with Humans and LLMs

# 摘要

> 本文评估了微调后的 BART Large 模型在创意小说写作方面的表现，并将其与人类及 GPT-3.5 和 GPT-4o 进行对比。我们进行了两个实验：一是读者对模型和人类故事的评估，二是对各模型生成故事的文本特征进行定性分析。结果显示，BART Large 在语法性、相关性和吸引力等方面均优于人类，仅在创造性上稍逊一筹，总体得分高出 14%。定性分析表明，GPT-4o 虽在一致性上近乎完美，但故事新颖度仅 3%；而 BART 的故事新颖度达 15%，显示了更高的创造力。本研究揭示了模型规模和微调对创意写作中创造性、流畅性和一致性平衡的影响。

> In this paper, we evaluate the creative fiction writing abilities of a fine-tuned small language model (SLM), BART Large, and compare its performance to humans and two large language models (LLMs): GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o. Our evaluation consists of two experiments: (i) a human evaluation where readers assess the stories generated by the SLM compared to human-written stories, and (ii) a qualitative linguistic analysis comparing the textual characteristics of the stories generated by the different models. In the first experiment, we asked 68 participants to rate short stories generated by the models and humans along dimensions such as grammaticality, relevance, creativity, and attractiveness. BART Large outperformed human writers in most aspects, except creativity, with an overall score of 2.11 compared to 1.85 for human-written texts -- a 14% improvement. In the second experiment, the qualitative analysis revealed that, while GPT-4o exhibited near-perfect internal and external coherence, it tended to produce more predictable narratives, with only 3% of its stories seen as novel. In contrast, 15% of BART's stories were considered novel, indicating a higher degree of creativity despite its smaller model size. This study provides both quantitative and qualitative insights into how model size and fine-tuning influence the balance between creativity, fluency, and coherence in creative writing tasks.
