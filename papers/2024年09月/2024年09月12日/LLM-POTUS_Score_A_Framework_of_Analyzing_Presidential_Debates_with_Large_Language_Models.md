> LLM-POTUS Score: A Framework of Analyzing Presidential Debates with Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型在自然语言处理中表现出色，但在政治话语分析中的应用仍待深入。本文提出了一种利用LLMs评估总统辩论的新方法，旨在客观评估辩论结果。我们设计的框架分析候选人的“政策、人格和观点”（3P）与四大关键群体（选民、企业、捐赠者和政治家）的“利益、意识形态和身份”（3I）的共鸣。通过生成LLM-POTUS分数，我们的方法量化了辩论表现。实证分析显示，该框架能细致评估候选人表现，揭示辩论策略对不同群体的影响。这不仅为政治分析提供了新工具，还探讨了LLMs在复杂社会背景下作为公正裁判的潜力与局限。此外，该框架为公民提供了独立评估辩论的工具，增强了民主参与，减少了偏见影响，强化了公民知情参与的基础。

> Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, yet their application to political discourse analysis remains underexplored. This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluating presidential debate performances using LLMs, addressing the longstanding challenge of objectively assessing debate outcomes. We propose a framework that analyzes candidates' "Policies, Persona, and Perspective" (3P) and how they resonate with the "Interests, Ideologies, and Identity" (3I) of four key audience groups: voters, businesses, donors, and politicians. Our method employs large language models to generate the LLM-POTUS Score, a quantitative measure of debate performance based on the alignment between 3P and 3I. We apply this framework to analyze transcripts from recent U.S. presidential debates, demonstrating its ability to provide nuanced, multi-dimensional assessments of candidate performances. Our results reveal insights into the effectiveness of different debating strategies and their impact on various audience segments. This study not only offers a new tool for political analysis but also explores the potential and limitations of using LLMs as impartial judges in complex social contexts. In addition, this framework provides individual citizens with an independent tool to evaluate presidential debate performances, which enhances democratic engagement and reduces reliance on potentially biased media interpretations and institutional influence, thereby strengthening the foundation of informed civic participation.
