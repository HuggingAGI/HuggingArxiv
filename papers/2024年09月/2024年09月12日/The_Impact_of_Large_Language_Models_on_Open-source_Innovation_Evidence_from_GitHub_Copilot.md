> The Impact of Large Language Models on Open-source Innovation: Evidence from GitHub Copilot

# 摘要

> 生成式 AI (GenAI) 在引导环境下已显示出提升个人生产力的潜力。尽管它也可能改变协作工作流程，但其变革路径尚不明朗。协作环境通常涉及从零开始的原创任务和基于他人工作的迭代任务。GenAI 如何影响这两类任务及其影响程度，仍是一个待解的经验问题。我们在开源开发领域进行了研究，这是一个典型的协作创新场景，贡献者自愿且无引导。我们特别关注了 2021 年 10 月 GitHub Copilot 的发布，并利用其对 Python 而非 R 的选择性支持，进行了一次自然实验。结果显示，整体贡献显著增加，表明 GenAI 在无引导环境下有效促进了协作创新。值得注意的是，Copilot 的发布大幅提升了维护相关贡献（多为迭代任务），而对代码开发贡献（多为原创任务）的影响较小。这种差异在活跃且编码活动频繁的项目中尤为明显，引发了对 GenAI 模型改进可能导致原创与迭代解决方案差距扩大的担忧。我们进一步探讨了激励高价值创新解决方案的实际和政策影响。

> Generative AI (GenAI) has been shown to enhance individual productivity in a guided setting. While it is also likely to transform processes in a collaborative work setting, it is unclear what trajectory this transformation will follow. Collaborative environment is characterized by a blend of origination tasks that involve building something from scratch and iteration tasks that involve refining on others' work. Whether GenAI affects these two aspects of collaborative work and to what extent is an open empirical question. We study this question within the open-source development landscape, a prime example of collaborative innovation, where contributions are voluntary and unguided. Specifically, we focus on the launch of GitHub Copilot in October 2021 and leverage a natural experiment in which GitHub Copilot (a programming-focused LLM) selectively rolled out support for Python, but not for R. We observe a significant jump in overall contributions, suggesting that GenAI effectively augments collaborative innovation in an unguided setting. Interestingly, Copilot's launch increased maintenance-related contributions, which are mostly iterative tasks involving building on others' work, significantly more than code-development contributions, which are mostly origination tasks involving standalone contributions. This disparity was exacerbated in active projects with extensive coding activity, raising concerns that, as GenAI models improve to accommodate richer context, the gap between origination and iterative solutions may widen. We discuss practical and policy implications to incentivize high-value innovative solutions.
