> 在现代智能教育应用中，知识标签对于问题至关重要，涵盖学习进度诊断、练习题推荐和课程内容组织。传统上，这些标签由教育专家完成，因其需要深刻的语义理解和逻辑联系能力。随着NLP技术的发展，如预训练语言模型和LLM，研究者开始探索自动化知识标签。本文探讨了多代理系统在处理复杂知识定义和数值约束方面的优势，并通过MathKnowCT数据集展示了其卓越性能。这凸显了LLM多代理系统在克服先前方法挑战中的潜力。最后，深入讨论了自动化知识标签的影响，强调了在教育领域应用LLM算法的积极成果。

> Knowledge tagging for questions is vital in modern intelligent educational applications, including learning progress diagnosis, practice question recommendations, and course content organization. Traditionally, these annotations have been performed by pedagogical experts, as the task demands not only a deep semantic understanding of question stems and knowledge definitions but also a strong ability to link problem-solving logic with relevant knowledge concepts. With the advent of advanced natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, such as pre-trained language models and large language models (LLMs), pioneering studies have explored automating the knowledge tagging process using various machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the use of a multi-agent system to address the limitations of previous algorithms, particularly in handling complex cases involving intricate knowledge definitions and strict numerical constraints. By demonstrating its superior performance on the publicly available math question knowledge tagging dataset, MathKnowCT, we highlight the significant potential of an LLM-based multi-agent system in overcoming the challenges that previous methods have encountered. Finally, through an in-depth discussion of the implications of automating knowledge tagging, we underscore the promising results of deploying LLM-based algorithms in educational contexts.
