> The Influence of Task and Group Disparities over Users' Attitudes Toward Using Large Language Models for Psychotherapy

# 摘要

> 近年来，心理健康问题日益增多，基于大型语言模型（LLM）的心理治疗也因此备受关注。然而，影响用户对这种新型治疗方式态度的因素却鲜有研究。本文首次探讨了任务和群体差异对用户态度的影响。通过在线调查，我们分析了222名中国用户的数据，发现心理健康状况显著影响用户态度，而隐私担忧则影响不大。这些发现为未来LLM心理治疗服务的设计提供了宝贵指导。

> The population suffering from mental health disorders has kept increasing in recent years. With the advancements in large language models (LLMs) in diverse fields, LLM-based psychotherapy has also attracted increasingly more attention. However, the factors influencing users' attitudes to LLM-based psychotherapy have rarely been explored. As the first attempt, this paper investigated the influence of task and group disparities on user attitudes toward LLM-based psychotherapy tools. Utilizing the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Automation Acceptance Model (AAM), based on an online survey, we collected and analyzed responses from 222 LLM-based psychotherapy users in mainland China. The results revealed that group disparity (i.e., mental health conditions) can influence users' attitudes toward LLM tools. Further, one of the typical task disparities, i.e., the privacy concern, was not found to have a significant effect on trust and usage intention. These findings can guide the design of future LLM-based psychotherapy services.
