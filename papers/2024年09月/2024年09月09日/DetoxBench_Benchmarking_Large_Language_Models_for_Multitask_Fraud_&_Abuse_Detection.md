> DetoxBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Multitask Fraud & Abuse Detection

# 摘要

> 大型语言模型（LLM）在自然语言处理方面表现出色，但在高风险领域如欺诈和滥用检测中的应用仍需深入探索。现有应用多局限于特定任务，如毒性或仇恨言论检测。本文介绍了一套全面基准，用于评估 LLM 在识别和缓解各类欺诈与滥用语言中的表现。基准涵盖检测垃圾邮件、仇恨言论、厌恶女性语言等多样化任务。我们评估了多个顶尖 LLM，包括 Anthropic、Mistral AI 和 AI21 系列模型，发现尽管 LLM 在单项任务中表现优异，但在需要细致推理的任务中表现参差不齐，尤其是识别多种厌恶女性语言的任务。这些发现对高风险应用中 LLM 的开发与部署具有重要意义。我们的基准套件可帮助研究人员和从业者系统评估 LLM 的多任务欺诈检测能力，推动构建更强大、可信赖且符合伦理的欺诈与滥用检测系统。

> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks. However, their practical application in high-stake domains, such as fraud and abuse detection, remains an area that requires further exploration. The existing applications often narrowly focus on specific tasks like toxicity or hate speech detection. In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to assess the performance of LLMs in identifying and mitigating fraudulent and abusive language across various real-world scenarios. Our benchmark encompasses a diverse set of tasks, including detecting spam emails, hate speech, misogynistic language, and more. We evaluated several state-of-the-art LLMs, including models from Anthropic, Mistral AI, and the AI21 family, to provide a comprehensive assessment of their capabilities in this critical domain. The results indicate that while LLMs exhibit proficient baseline performance in individual fraud and abuse detection tasks, their performance varies considerably across tasks, particularly struggling with tasks that demand nuanced pragmatic reasoning, such as identifying diverse forms of misogynistic language. These findings have important implications for the responsible development and deployment of LLMs in high-risk applications. Our benchmark suite can serve as a tool for researchers and practitioners to systematically evaluate LLMs for multi-task fraud detection and drive the creation of more robust, trustworthy, and ethically-aligned systems for fraud and abuse detection.
