# 摘要

> 本文介绍了一种新颖的对话式AI驱动的主动创意思维界面，帮助新手设计师克服创意瓶颈。该界面通过动态互动和情境响应，利用大型语言模型生成多样化的设计想法。结合AI模型与创意思维，形成主动创意思维场景，促进持续对话和创意生成。试点研究显示，该工具能有效生成丰富、多样和新颖的创意。通过结构化对话风格，界面更便于设计师使用，响应也更简洁，与后续设计阶段更一致。本文展示了生成式AI在创意设计早期阶段的巨大潜力。

> This paper presents a novel conversational AI-enabled active ideation interface as a creative idea-generation tool to assist novice designers in mitigating the initial latency and ideation bottlenecks that are commonly observed. It is a dynamic, interactive, and contextually responsive approach, actively involving a large language model (LLM) from the domain of natural language processing (NLP) in artificial intelligence (AI) to produce multiple statements of potential ideas for different design problems. Integrating such AI models with ideation creates what we refer to as an Active Ideation scenario, which helps foster continuous dialogue-based interaction, context-sensitive conversation, and prolific idea generation. A pilot study was conducted with thirty novice designers to generate ideas for given problems using traditional methods and the new CAI-based interface. The key parameters of fluency, novelty, and variety were used to compare the outcomes qualitatively by a panel of experts. The findings demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed tool for generating prolific, diverse and novel ideas. The interface was enhanced by incorporating a prompt-engineered structured dialogue style for each ideation stage to make it uniform and more convenient for the designers. The resulting responses of such a structured CAI interface were found to be more succinct and aligned towards the subsequent design stage, namely conceptualization. The paper thus established the rich potential of using Generative AI (Gen-AI) for the early ill-structured phase of the creative product design process.
