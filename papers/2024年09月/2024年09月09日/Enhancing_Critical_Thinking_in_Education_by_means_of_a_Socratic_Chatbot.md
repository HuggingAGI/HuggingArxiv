> Enhancing Critical Thinking in Education by means of a Socratic Chatbot

# 摘要

> 尽管大型语言模型 (LLM) 在教育中日益重要，但其促进批判性思维的潜力仍未充分探索。本文填补了这一空白，介绍了一种创新的教育聊天机器人，通过苏格拉底式提问促进批判性思维。与传统智能辅导系统不同，苏格拉底导师通过提出结构化、发人深省的问题，鼓励学生探索多重视角并进行自我反思。我们通过微调和提示调整开源预训练 LLM，使用专门数据集实现这一目标。为实现民主化访问并保护隐私，该导师基于本地运行的小型 LLM（Llama2 7B 和 13B 参数模型）。实验结果表明，苏格拉底导师在促进反思和批判性思维方面显著优于标准聊天机器人。这一方法为通过培养主动学习和智力自主来改善教育成果提供了新途径。

> While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly playing a pivotal role in education by providing instantaneous, adaptive responses, their potential to promote critical thinking remains understudied. In this paper, we fill such a gap and present an innovative educational chatbot designed to foster critical thinking through Socratic questioning. Unlike traditional intelligent tutoring systems, including educational chatbots, that tend to offer direct answers, the proposed Socratic tutor encourages students to explore various perspectives and engage in self-reflection by posing structured, thought-provoking questions. Our Socratic questioning is implemented by fine and prompt-tuning the open-source pretrained LLM with a specialized dataset that stimulates critical thinking and offers multiple viewpoints. In an effort to democratize access and to protect the students' privacy, the proposed tutor is based on small LLMs (Llama2 7B and 13B-parameter models) that are able to run locally on off-the-shelf hardware. We validate our approach in a battery of experiments consisting of interactions between a simulated student and the chatbot to evaluate its effectiveness in enhancing critical thinking skills. Results indicate that the Socratic tutor supports the development of reflection and critical thinking significantly better than standard chatbots. Our approach opens the door for improving educational outcomes by cultivating active learning and encouraging intellectual autonomy.
