# 摘要

> 自杀是全球亟待解决的问题，心理支持热线已被证明是有效的干预手段。在中国，每年有约200万人尝试自杀，多次尝试者不在少数。及时识别和干预高风险个体至关重要。随着AI技术的进步，特别是LLMs的发展，心理健康领域迎来了新的技术工具。本研究涉及1284名受试者，旨在验证深度学习模型和LLMs能否有效预测自杀风险。我们设计了一个基于LLM的简单流程，先总结一小时语音的转录文本以提取关键特征，再预测未来的自杀行为。在临床环境中，我们将此方法与传统手动量表和五种先进深度学习模型进行了比较。结果显示，该LLM流程在46名受试者的测试集上表现优异，与手动量表结合时，F1得分为76%，比最佳语音深度学习模型高出7%，比单独使用手动量表提高了27.82%。这表明LLMs在自杀预防中具有巨大潜力。

> Suicide is a pressing global issue, demanding urgent and effective preventive interventions. Among the various strategies in place, psychological support hotlines had proved as a potent intervention method. Approximately two million people in China attempt suicide annually, with many individuals making multiple attempts. Prompt identification and intervention for high-risk individuals are crucial to preventing tragedies. With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), especially the development of large-scale language models (LLMs), new technological tools have been introduced to the field of mental health. This study included 1284 subjects, and was designed to validate whether deep learning models and LLMs, using audio and transcribed text from support hotlines, can effectively predict suicide risk. We proposed a simple LLM-based pipeline that first summarizes transcribed text from approximately one hour of speech to extract key features, and then predict suicidial bahaviours in the future. We compared our LLM-based method with the traditional manual scale approach in a clinical setting and with five advanced deep learning models. Surprisingly, the proposed simple LLM pipeline achieved strong performance on a test set of 46 subjects, with an F1 score of 76\% when combined with manual scale rating. This is 7\% higher than the best speech-based deep learning models and represents a 27.82\% point improvement in F1 score compared to using the manual scale apporach alone. Our study explores new applications of LLMs and demonstrates their potential for future use in suicide prevention efforts.
