# 摘要

> 利用 Lean 4 这样的计算机可验证语言证明数学定理，极大地推动了数学形式化。Lean 4 在提升数学推理方面潜力巨大，但现有研究多聚焦于数学形式化语言，并努力追赶语言的快速演变。为连接传统与计算机化证明，我提出基于自然语言证明，利用大型语言模型生成形式化步骤和完整证明。此方法不仅介绍基本结构与策略，还探讨AI如何助力数学形式化，提升其效能，并通过IMO问题与抽象代数定理的实例，对比Lean 4与自然语言的表现。

> Using computerized verifiable formal languages like Lean 4 to prove mathematical theorems has a significant impact on mathematical formalization. Lean 4 offers prominent potential for advancing mathematical reasoning. However, existing efforts are limited to mathematical formalization languages in substantial online corpora and are dedicated to keeping pace with rapidly evolving languages. To bridge the gap between the traditional and computerized proof, my approach to formalizing theorem proving involves generating formal steps and complete proofs using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Natural Language (NL) proofs. The method is to introduce the basic structure and tactics in general, determine how AI can assist the mathematical formalization process to improve its performance, and give examples of solving problems in Lean 4 comparing to NL, mainly in IMO, and a sample theorem proving in abstract algebra.
