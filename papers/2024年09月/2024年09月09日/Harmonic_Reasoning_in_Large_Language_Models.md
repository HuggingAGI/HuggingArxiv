# 摘要

> LLM 在艺术等领域的应用日益广泛，但在逻辑推理和计数任务上仍显不足。本文探讨了 LLM 在音乐任务中的表现，如音程、和弦和音阶的识别。测试结果显示，LLM 在音程处理上表现尚可，但在和弦和音阶识别上则显得力不从心。这揭示了 LLM 的局限性，并指明了改进方向，有望提升其在艺术及其他复杂领域的应用效果。此外，我们还提供了一个自动生成的基准数据集，以供进一步研究。

> Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming very popular and are used for many different purposes, including creative tasks in the arts. However, these models sometimes have trouble with specific reasoning tasks, especially those that involve logical thinking and counting. This paper looks at how well LLMs understand and reason when dealing with musical tasks like figuring out notes from intervals and identifying chords and scales. We tested GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o to see how they handle these tasks. Our results show that while LLMs do well with note intervals, they struggle with more complicated tasks like recognizing chords and scales. This points out clear limits in current LLM abilities and shows where we need to make them better, which could help improve how they think and work in both artistic and other complex areas. We also provide an automatically generated benchmark data set for the described tasks.
