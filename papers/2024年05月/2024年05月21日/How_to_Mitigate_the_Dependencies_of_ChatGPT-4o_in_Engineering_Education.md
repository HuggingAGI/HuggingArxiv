# 摘要

> 随着大型多模态模型（LMMs）的迅猛发展，现代教育，尤其是计算机工程领域，正经历深刻变革。LMMs 虽为学习带来无限可能，但也对传统教学构成挑战，可能导致对自动化工具的过度依赖。为此，我们设计了一系列课程策略，旨在减少对 LMMs 的依赖，如 ChatGPT-4o，并强调实践性问题解决。实际课程的实施初步证明，这些策略不仅提升了学生的参与度和理解力，更在拥抱科技的同时，坚守了传统学习的核心价值。

> The rapid evolution of large multimodal models (LMMs) has significantly impacted modern teaching and learning, especially in computer engineering. While LMMs offer extensive opportunities for enhancing learning, they also risk undermining traditional teaching methods and fostering excessive reliance on automated solutions. To counter this, we have developed strategies within curriculum to reduce the dependencies on LMMs that represented by ChatGPT-4o. These include designing course topics that encourage hands-on problem-solving. The proposed strategies were demonstrated through an actual course implementation. Preliminary results show that the methods effectively enhance student engagement and understanding, balancing the benefits of technology with the preservation of traditional learning principles.
