理由：这篇论文主要探讨了微动作（MG）在情感理解中的作用，并提出了一种时空平衡融合方法来增强微动作的识别。论文中提到的使用大型语言模型评估微动作在情感理解中的角色，以及其在欺骗检测和面试等场景中的应用，表明这是一个关于智能Agent如何利用微动作进行情感理解和决策的研究。因此，它更符合Agent分类，而不是RAG、LLM应用或LLM理论。` `情感识别` `人工智能`

> Identity-free Artificial Emotional Intelligence via Micro-Gesture Understanding

# 摘要

> 本研究聚焦于人类身体语言中的微动作（MG），这类动作非有意为之，而是内心情感的自然流露。微动作的这一特性带来了两个新挑战：一是传统动作识别策略是否适用于微动作；二是微动作作为补充数据，能否深化情感理解。我们针对微动作的细微空间和短暂时间特性，探索了多种增强策略，并引入了一种简便高效的时空平衡融合方法。实验不仅在微动作数据集上验证了我们的方法，还在主流动作数据集上取得了领先成果。此外，我们构建了复杂的情感推理场景，通过大型语言模型评估，证实微动作在情感理解中扮演了重要角色。这些场景还可应用于其他基于微动作的任务，如欺骗检测和面试。我们的研究为微动作和情感人工智能领域带来了新的启示。

> In this work, we focus on a special group of human body language -- the micro-gesture (MG), which differs from the range of ordinary illustrative gestures in that they are not intentional behaviors performed to convey information to others, but rather unintentional behaviors driven by inner feelings. This characteristic introduces two novel challenges regarding micro-gestures that are worth rethinking. The first is whether strategies designed for other action recognition are entirely applicable to micro-gestures. The second is whether micro-gestures, as supplementary data, can provide additional insights for emotional understanding. In recognizing micro-gestures, we explored various augmentation strategies that take into account the subtle spatial and brief temporal characteristics of micro-gestures, often accompanied by repetitiveness, to determine more suitable augmentation methods. Considering the significance of temporal domain information for micro-gestures, we introduce a simple and efficient plug-and-play spatiotemporal balancing fusion method. We not only studied our method on the considered micro-gesture dataset but also conducted experiments on mainstream action datasets. The results show that our approach performs well in micro-gesture recognition and on other datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to previous micro-gesture recognition methods. For emotional understanding based on micro-gestures, we construct complex emotional reasoning scenarios. Our evaluation, conducted with large language models, shows that micro-gestures play a significant and positive role in enhancing comprehensive emotional understanding. The scenarios we developed can be extended to other micro-gesture-based tasks such as deception detection and interviews. We confirm that our new insights contribute to advancing research in micro-gesture and emotional artificial intelligence.
