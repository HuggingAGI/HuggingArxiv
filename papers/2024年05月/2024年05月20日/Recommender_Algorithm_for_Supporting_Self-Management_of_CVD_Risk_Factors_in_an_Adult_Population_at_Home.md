理由：这篇论文介绍了一种基于知识的多维推荐算法，该算法结合了规则逻辑与大型语言模型的能力，用于帮助成年人自我监控心血管疾病风险。这种算法可以被视为一个智能代理（Agent），因为它能够处理信息、做出决策并提供个性化的建议，以支持用户的健康管理。虽然它涉及到了大型语言模型的应用，但其核心在于作为一个智能系统来辅助用户，因此更适合归类为Agent。` `健康管理`

# 摘要

> 推荐算法的新趋势之一是扩展其功能，以帮助人们管理健康，特别是针对心血管疾病（CVD）的预防，这是全球头号杀手。为此，我们提出了一种基于知识的多维推荐算法，旨在帮助成年人在家中自我监控CVD风险。该算法不仅依据官方指南评估当前健康状况，还预测未来CVD风险，并结合了规则逻辑与大型语言模型的能力，生成类似人类的文本，以增强推荐的解释性。评估显示，该算法在支持个人自我管理CVD风险方面表现出色，相较于同类算法，它能评估更多风险因素，并提供更丰富、更具语义的推荐内容。

> One of the new trends in the development of recommendation algorithms is the dissemination of their capabilities to support the population in managing their health. This article focuses on the problem of improving the effectiveness of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) prevention, since CVD is the leading cause of death worldwide. To address this issue, a knowledge-based recommendation algorithm was proposed to support self-management of CVD risk factors in adults at home. The proposed algorithm is based on the original multidimensional recommendation model and on a new user profile model, which includes predictive assessments of CVD health in addition to its current ones as outlined in official guidelines. The main feature of the proposed algorithm is the combination of rule-based logic with the capabilities of a large language model in generating human-like text for explanatory component of multidimensional recommendation. The verification and evaluation of the proposed algorithm showed the usefulness of the proposed recommendation algorithm for supporting adults in self-management of their CVD risk factors at home. As follows from the comparison with similar knowledge-based recommendation algorithms, the proposed algorithm evaluates a larger number of CVD risk factors and has a greater information and semantic capacity of the generated recommendations.
