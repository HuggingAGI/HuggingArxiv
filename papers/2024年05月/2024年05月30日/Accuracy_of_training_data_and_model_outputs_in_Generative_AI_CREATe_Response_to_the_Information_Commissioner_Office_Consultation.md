> Accuracy of training data and model outputs in Generative AI: CREATe Response to the Information Commissioner Office Consultation

# 摘要

> 随着大型语言模型的普及，生成式AI的准确性日益重要。训练数据的潜在缺陷和输出中的幻觉可能导致基于错误信息的决策，从而影响个人利益。因此，确保模型准确性既是技术要求，也是监管重点。ICO对生成式AI准确性的证据征集恰逢其时，旨在推动负责任的AI发展。CREATe，作为格拉斯哥大学的创意经济监管中心，已开展多项涉及知识产权和科技法律的研究。我们积极响应ICO的征集，并强调数据保护和AI监管的重要性。

> The accuracy of Generative AI is increasingly critical as Large Language Models become more widely adopted. Due to potential flaws in training data and hallucination in outputs, inaccuracy can significantly impact individuals interests by distorting perceptions and leading to decisions based on flawed information. Therefore, ensuring these models accuracy is not only a technical necessity but also a regulatory imperative. ICO call for evidence on the accuracy of Generative AI marks a timely effort in ensuring responsible Generative AI development and use.
  CREATe, as the Centre for Regulation of the Creative Economy based at the University of Glasgow, has conducted relevant research involving intellectual property, competition, information and technology law. We welcome the ICO call for evidence on the accuracy of Generative AI, and we are happy to highlight aspects of data protection law and AI regulation that we believe should receive attention.
