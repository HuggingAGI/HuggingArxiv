> What Can Natural Language Processing Do for Peer Review?

# 摘要

> 科学文章的产量激增，质量把控成为科学界乃至公众利益的基石。同行评审，这一由领域内专家独立评估的分布式过程，虽广泛应用，却充满挑战，耗时且易错。鉴于评审材料多为文本，自然语言处理（NLP）技术大有可为。随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的崛起，NLP在同行评审中的辅助作用日益受到关注。但究竟何处需援手，NLP又该如何施展其能，何时应保持距离？我们的论文旨在为NLP在同行评审辅助领域的未来研究奠定基石。我们以AI会议评审为例，深入探讨同行评审的全过程，从提交到最终修订，揭示NLP辅助的挑战与机遇。我们进一步探讨NLP在同行评审中的重大挑战，包括数据获取、实验操作及伦理考量。为了凝聚社区力量，我们建立了一个汇集关键同行评审数据集的配套资源库。最后，我们向科学界、NLP与AI研究者、政策制定者及资助机构发出行动号召，共同推动NLP在同行评审领域的研究。我们期望这份工作能够为AI时代机器辅助科学质量控制的研究议程设定方向，不仅限于NLP领域，更触及更广阔的科学天地。

> The number of scientific articles produced every year is growing rapidly. Providing quality control over them is crucial for scientists and, ultimately, for the public good. In modern science, this process is largely delegated to peer review -- a distributed procedure in which each submission is evaluated by several independent experts in the field. Peer review is widely used, yet it is hard, time-consuming, and prone to error. Since the artifacts involved in peer review -- manuscripts, reviews, discussions -- are largely text-based, Natural Language Processing has great potential to improve reviewing. As the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has enabled NLP assistance for many new tasks, the discussion on machine-assisted peer review is picking up the pace. Yet, where exactly is help needed, where can NLP help, and where should it stand aside? The goal of our paper is to provide a foundation for the future efforts in NLP for peer-reviewing assistance. We discuss peer review as a general process, exemplified by reviewing at AI conferences. We detail each step of the process from manuscript submission to camera-ready revision, and discuss the associated challenges and opportunities for NLP assistance, illustrated by existing work. We then turn to the big challenges in NLP for peer review as a whole, including data acquisition and licensing, operationalization and experimentation, and ethical issues. To help consolidate community efforts, we create a companion repository that aggregates key datasets pertaining to peer review. Finally, we issue a detailed call for action for the scientific community, NLP and AI researchers, policymakers, and funding bodies to help bring the research in NLP for peer review forward. We hope that our work will help set the agenda for research in machine-assisted scientific quality control in the age of AI, within the NLP community and beyond.
