# 摘要

> 随着计算机科学课程报名人数的增加和班级规模的扩大，我们需要可扩展且自动化的辅导解决方案来支持学生学习。尽管GPT-3.5等大型语言模型在问答辅助方面显示出潜力，但教育者对学生可能滥用这些模型或模型提供错误答案表示担忧。为此，本文引入了CourseAssist，一个专为计算机科学教育定制的基于LLM的辅导系统。与通用LLM系统不同，CourseAssist通过检索增强生成、用户意图分类和后处理技术，确保回答与课程学习目标一致，从而解决了LLM在教育中的适用性问题。通过对比GPT 3.5基线，使用编程语言课程的50个问答对数据进行评估，重点关注有用性、准确性和教学适当性，结果显示CourseAssist表现显著更优，显示出其作为有效学习助教的潜力。这项研究不仅强调了基于LLM教育工具设计的重要性，还为未来研究，特别是用户与系统在实际场景中的交互以及将人类教育者融入LLM辅导系统，开辟了新的方向。

> The growing enrollments in computer science courses and increase in class sizes necessitate scalable, automated tutoring solutions to adequately support student learning. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 have demonstrated potential in assisting students through question-answering, educators have significant concerns about students misusing LLMs or LLMs misleading students with inaccurate answers. This paper introduces CourseAssist, a novel LLM-based tutoring system tailored for computer science education. Unlike generic LLM systems, CourseAssist leverages retrieval-augmented generation along with user intent classification and post-processing to ensure that responses align with specific course learning goals, thereby addressing the pedagogical appropriateness of LLMs in educational settings. I evaluate CourseAssist against a baseline of GPT 3.5 using a dataset of 50 question-answer pairs from a programming languages course, focusing on the criteria of usefulness, accuracy, and pedagogical appropriateness. Evaluation results show that CourseAssist significantly outperforms the baseline, demonstrating its potential to serve as an effective learning assistant. This work not only highlights the importance of deliberate design considerations in LLM-based educational tools but also opens up avenues for future research, particularly in understanding user interactions with such systems in real-world scenarios and integrating human educators into LLM-based tutoring systems.
