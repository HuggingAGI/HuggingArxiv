> "Ask Me Anything": How Comcast Uses LLMs to Assist Agents in Real Time

# 摘要

> 客户服务是企业与客户沟通的桥梁，对提升客户满意度起着关键作用。然而，优质客户服务的成本不菲，这促使企业寻求成本效益最大化的解决方案，如采用AI驱动的“聊天机器人”。尽管如此，客户在面对复杂问题或敏感话题时，仍倾向于寻求人与人之间的直接交流。这对客服代表提出了更高要求：他们必须精准把握客户的问题或疑虑，找到既符合客户期望又在公司政策允许范围内的解决方案，同时还要应对多线对话的挑战。本研究提出了“问我任何问题”（AMA）功能，作为客服代表界面的一个新增模块。该功能允许客服代表在与客户交流时，即时向大型语言模型（LLM）提出问题，获取实时准确的回答，从而减少代表在处理对话时的上下文切换。内部实验显示，使用AMA的代表在包含搜索的对话中，平均用时减少了约10%，这为公司每年节省了数百万美元。此外，使用AMA功能的代表中，有近80%给出了正面反馈，显示出这一AI辅助工具在客户服务中的显著价值。

> Customer service is how companies interface with their customers. It can contribute heavily towards the overall customer satisfaction. However, high-quality service can become expensive, creating an incentive to make it as cost efficient as possible and prompting most companies to utilize AI-powered assistants, or "chat bots". On the other hand, human-to-human interaction is still desired by customers, especially when it comes to complex scenarios such as disputes and sensitive topics like bill payment.
  This raises the bar for customer service agents. They need to accurately understand the customer's question or concern, identify a solution that is acceptable yet feasible (and within the company's policy), all while handling multiple conversations at once.
  In this work, we introduce "Ask Me Anything" (AMA) as an add-on feature to an agent-facing customer service interface. AMA allows agents to ask questions to a large language model (LLM) on demand, as they are handling customer conversations -- the LLM provides accurate responses in real-time, reducing the amount of context switching the agent needs. In our internal experiments, we find that agents using AMA versus a traditional search experience spend approximately 10% fewer seconds per conversation containing a search, translating to millions of dollars of savings annually. Agents that used the AMA feature provided positive feedback nearly 80% of the time, demonstrating its usefulness as an AI-assisted feature for customer care.
