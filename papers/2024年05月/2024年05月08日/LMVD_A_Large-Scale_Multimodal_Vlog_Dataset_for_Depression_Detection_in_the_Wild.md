> LMVD: A Large-Scale Multimodal Vlog Dataset for Depression Detection in the Wild

# 摘要

> 抑郁症对个体的多方面生活产生显著影响，包括个人与社交功能、学业与工作表现及生活质量。情感计算领域的研究者正利用深度学习技术探索抑郁症检测的潜在模式。然而，受试者隐私保护的顾虑导致相关数据稀缺，给抑郁症检测的深度判别模型带来挑战。为此，我们构建了大规模多模态vlog数据集LMVD，用于自然环境下的抑郁症识别，包含1823个样本，总计214小时，来自1475名参与者，采集自新浪微博、哔哩哔哔、抖音和YouTube四大平台。我们提出MDDformer架构，专门学习个体非言语行为。在LMVD数据集上的广泛验证表明，该架构在抑郁症检测中表现卓越。我们期待LMVD为抑郁症检测领域贡献重要价值。数据与代码将通过以下链接发布：https://github.com/helang818/LMVD/。

> Depression can significantly impact many aspects of an individual's life, including their personal and social functioning, academic and work performance, and overall quality of life. Many researchers within the field of affective computing are adopting deep learning technology to explore potential patterns related to the detection of depression. However, because of subjects' privacy protection concerns, that data in this area is still scarce, presenting a challenge for the deep discriminative models used in detecting depression. To navigate these obstacles, a large-scale multimodal vlog dataset (LMVD), for depression recognition in the wild is built. In LMVD, which has 1823 samples with 214 hours of the 1475 participants captured from four multimedia platforms (Sina Weibo, Bilibili, Tiktok, and YouTube). A novel architecture termed MDDformer to learn the non-verbal behaviors of individuals is proposed. Extensive validations are performed on the LMVD dataset, demonstrating superior performance for depression detection. We anticipate that the LMVD will contribute a valuable function to the depression detection community. The data and code will released at the link: https://github.com/helang818/LMVD/.
