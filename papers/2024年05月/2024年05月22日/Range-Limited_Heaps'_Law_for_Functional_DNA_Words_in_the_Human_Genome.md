理由：这篇论文探讨了Heaps'定律在基因组中的应用，特别是在DNA单词和蛋白质域的背景下。虽然这与基因组学有关，但其核心是关于语言模型理论的扩展，即如何将语言学中的定律应用于生物信息学领域。因此，它更符合LLM理论分类，因为它涉及语言模型理论在非传统领域的应用和探索。` `生物信息学` `基因组学`

> Range-Limited Heaps' Law for Functional DNA Words in the Human Genome

# 摘要

> Heaps' 定律描述了词汇量与单词计数之间的幂律关系，但在基因组中，由于 DNA 词典大小远小于人类语言，其存在性尚不明确。我们定义基因组中的 DNA 单词为编码蛋白质域的区域，并通过人类染色体样本证实了 Heaps' 定律在有限范围内的存在。与大型语言模型中短序列的定义不同，我们的定义更贴合基因组和蛋白质组。尽管蛋白质域大小的幂律分布因基因复制而广为人知，但将其映射到 DNA 单词的 Heaps' 定律并非直接。其他动物基因组也显示出基于我们定义的范围有限的 Heaps' 定律，其指数因物种复杂度而异。研究 Heaps' 定律及其指数，为我们从语言学视角理解蛋白质域的再利用、冗余和新域的创造提供了新视角。

> Heaps' or Herdan's law is a linguistic law describing the relationship between the vocabulary/dictionary size (type) and word counts (token) to be a power-law function. Its existence in genomes with certain definition of DNA words is unclear partly because the dictionary size in genome could be much smaller than that in a human language. We define a DNA word in a genome as a DNA coding region that codes for a protein domain. Using human chromosomes and chromosome arms as individual samples, we establish the existence of Heaps' law in the human genome within limited range. Our definition of words in a genomic or proteomic context is different from that in large language models for DNA or protein sequences where words are usually short. Although an approximate power-law distribution of protein domain sizes due to gene duplication and the related Zipf's law is well known, their translation to the Heaps' law in DNA words is not automatic. Several other animal genomes are shown herein also to exhibit range-limited Heaps' law with our definition of DNA words, though with various exponents, partially depending on their level of complexity. Investigation of Heaps' law and its exponent value could provide an alternative narrative of reusage and redundancy of protein domains as well as creation of new protein domains from a linguistic perspective.
