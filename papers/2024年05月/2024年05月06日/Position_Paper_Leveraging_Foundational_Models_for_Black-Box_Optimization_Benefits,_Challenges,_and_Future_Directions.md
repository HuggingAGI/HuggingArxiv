# 摘要

> 确实，大型语言模型（LLMs）在机器学习研究领域引发了一场创新的浪潮，对多个领域产生了显著的影响，并迅速推动了该领域的范式变革。然而，实验设计这一领域，尤其是基于黑箱优化的部分，受到这种变革的影响相对较小。尽管如此，将LLMs整合到优化中，为我们开辟了一个新的探索领域。在本篇立场论文中，我们以序列为基础的基础模型为中心，构建了黑箱优化的研究框架，并梳理了其与现有文献的联系。我们探讨了基础语言模型如何通过利用文本中的丰富信息来增强任务理解、运用灵活的序列模型如Transformer来开发更高效的优化策略，以及如何提升对未知搜索空间的性能预测，从而引领优化领域的革命。

> Undeniably, Large Language Models (LLMs) have stirred an extraordinary wave of innovation in the machine learning research domain, resulting in substantial impact across diverse fields such as reinforcement learning, robotics, and computer vision. Their incorporation has been rapid and transformative, marking a significant paradigm shift in the field of machine learning research.
  However, the field of experimental design, grounded on black-box optimization, has been much less affected by such a paradigm shift, even though integrating LLMs with optimization presents a unique landscape ripe for exploration. In this position paper, we frame the field of black-box optimization around sequence-based foundation models and organize their relationship with previous literature. We discuss the most promising ways foundational language models can revolutionize optimization, which include harnessing the vast wealth of information encapsulated in free-form text to enrich task comprehension, utilizing highly flexible sequence models such as Transformers to engineer superior optimization strategies, and enhancing performance prediction over previously unseen search spaces.
