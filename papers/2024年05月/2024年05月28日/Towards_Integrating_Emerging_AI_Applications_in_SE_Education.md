> Towards Integrating Emerging AI Applications in SE Education

# 摘要

> 人工智能（AI）已深入现代学习环境与软件工程（SE）课程多年。然而，随着大型语言模型（LLMs）如OpenAI的ChatGPT的流行，教育界正面临课堂环境的剧变与教学原则的挑战。从ChatGPT生成的完整编程作业到考试作弊，问题层出不穷。尽管如此，AI工具，尤其是LLM应用，也为SE课程带来了新机遇，助力师生。本研究初步分析了AI领域的趋势，并探讨了如何将其融入大学SE课程，以ACM的CS2023指南为依据。我们探讨了AI应用的新机遇及未来研究方向。

> Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches have been incorporated into modern learning environments and software engineering (SE) courses and curricula for several years. However, with the significant rise in popularity of large language models (LLMs) in general, and OpenAI's LLM-powered chatbot ChatGPT in particular in the last year, educators are faced with rapidly changing classroom environments and disrupted teaching principles. Examples range from programming assignment solutions that are fully generated via ChatGPT, to various forms of cheating during exams. However, despite these negative aspects and emerging challenges, AI tools in general, and LLM applications in particular, can also provide significant opportunities in a wide variety of SE courses, supporting both students and educators in meaningful ways. In this early research paper, we present preliminary results of a systematic analysis of current trends in the area of AI, and how they can be integrated into university-level SE curricula, guidelines, and approaches to support both instructors and learners. We collected both teaching and research papers and analyzed their potential usage in SE education, using the ACM Computer Science Curriculum Guidelines CS2023. As an initial outcome, we discuss a series of opportunities for AI applications and further research areas.
