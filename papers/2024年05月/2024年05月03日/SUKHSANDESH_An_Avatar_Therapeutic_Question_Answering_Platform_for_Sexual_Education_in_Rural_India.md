> SUKHSANDESH: An Avatar Therapeutic Question Answering Platform for Sexual Education in Rural India

# 摘要

> 性教育致力于促进青少年的情感、心理和社会健康。在印度等国家，青少年人口众多，他们在性健康领域面临诸多风险。遗憾的是，性教育常常遭遇污名化，阻碍了向这些易受伤害的青少年提供关键的咨询与信息。这导致早孕、不安全堕胎、性传播疾病和性暴力等问题频发。本提案旨在为印度农村地区的弱势群体提供一个安全、可靠的性教育平台，以促进国家的健康发展。我们致力于开发SUKHSANDESH，这是一个专为印度农村量身定制的、分阶段的AI问答系统，它遵循严格的安全准则，并支持地区语言。利用信息检索技术和大型语言模型，SUKHSANDESH将为用户提供精准的答复。我们计划对数据集进行匿名处理，以加强安全措施，并设置AI防护措施，防止不当或有害的响应生成。此外，我们的提案还包括一个创新功能，即将“化身疗法”与SUKHSANDESH结合。这一特性将AI生成的回复转化为由动画化身实时发声的音频，使用地区印度语言，旨在增强同理心和亲近感，尤其适合文化水平较低的群体。我们与行业先锋Gram Vaani合作，将SUKHSANDESH部署到印度农村，以满足当地的性教育需求。

> Sexual education aims to foster a healthy lifestyle in terms of emotional, mental and social well-being. In countries like India, where adolescents form the largest demographic group, they face significant vulnerabilities concerning sexual health. Unfortunately, sexual education is often stigmatized, creating barriers to providing essential counseling and information to this at-risk population. Consequently, issues such as early pregnancy, unsafe abortions, sexually transmitted infections, and sexual violence become prevalent. Our current proposal aims to provide a safe and trustworthy platform for sexual education to the vulnerable rural Indian population, thereby fostering the healthy and overall growth of the nation. In this regard, we strive towards designing SUKHSANDESH, a multi-staged AI-based Question Answering platform for sexual education tailored to rural India, adhering to safety guardrails and regional language support. By utilizing information retrieval techniques and large language models, SUKHSANDESH will deliver effective responses to user queries. We also propose to anonymise the dataset to mitigate safety measures and set AI guardrails against any harmful or unwanted response generation. Moreover, an innovative feature of our proposal involves integrating ``avatar therapy'' with SUKHSANDESH. This feature will convert AI-generated responses into real-time audio delivered by an animated avatar speaking regional Indian languages. This approach aims to foster empathy and connection, which is particularly beneficial for individuals with limited literacy skills. Partnering with Gram Vaani, an industry leader, we will deploy SUKHSANDESH to address sexual education needs in rural India.
