> LLMs in Political Science: Heralding a New Era of Visual Analysis

> 随着LLMs的崛起，政治科学家们愈发渴望利用图像中的海量信息，但以往受限于计算机视觉专业知识及专用硬件的需求，图像分析主要局限于该领域内一小部分人。本文探讨了运用Gemini进行图像内容分析的可能性，并通过回顾性分析688张图片的数据集，证实Gemini在执行政治科学家最常用的基础任务——对象检测上表现出极高的准确性。更令人欣喜的是，Gemini操作简便快捷，仅需一条自然语言指令即可完成任务，满足多数研究人员的时间需求，且完全免费、无需额外硬件支持。此外，我们还展示了如何借助Gemini开展更多图像理解任务，如人脸识别、情感分析及标题生成等。总之，Gemini及其他相似LLMs有潜力大幅推动并加快政治科学乃至社会科学界的图像研究进程。

> Interest is increasing among political scientists in leveraging the extensive information available in images. However, the challenge of interpreting these images lies in the need for specialized knowledge in computer vision and access to specialized hardware. As a result, image analysis has been limited to a relatively small group within the political science community. This landscape could potentially change thanks to the rise of large language models (LLMs). This paper aims to raise awareness of the feasibility of using Gemini for image content analysis. A retrospective analysis was conducted on a corpus of 688 images. Content reports were elicited from Gemini for each image and then manually evaluated by the authors. We find that Gemini is highly accurate in performing object detection, which is arguably the most common and fundamental task in image analysis for political scientists. Equally important, we show that it is easy to implement as the entire command consists of a single prompt in natural language; it is fast to run and should meet the time budget of most researchers; and it is free to use and does not require any specialized hardware. In addition, we illustrate how political scientists can leverage Gemini for other image understanding tasks, including face identification, sentiment analysis, and caption generation. Our findings suggest that Gemini and other similar LLMs have the potential to drastically stimulate and accelerate image research in political science and social sciences more broadly.
