> Shall We Talk: Exploring Spontaneous Collaborations of Competing LLM Agents

# 摘要

> 最新研究揭示，由大型语言模型（LLM）支持的智能体不仅能模拟人类行为和社会运作，还能在缺乏明确指示时自行建立合作关系。通过三项案例研究，我们发现LLM智能体甚至能在竞争情境中自发协作，这不仅证实了它们模仿人类社会竞争与合作行为的能力，也为计算社会科学的发展提供了新视角。具体而言，LLM智能体有潜力被用于模拟包含自发协作在内的人类社交互动，为我们理解社会现象提供了新的视角。相关研究的源代码已在 https://github.com/wuzengqing001225/SABM_ShallWeTalk 上公开。

> Recent advancements have shown that agents powered by large language models (LLMs) possess capabilities to simulate human behaviors and societal dynamics. However, the potential for LLM agents to spontaneously establish collaborative relationships in the absence of explicit instructions has not been studied. To address this gap, we conduct three case studies, revealing that LLM agents are capable of spontaneously forming collaborations even within competitive settings. This finding not only demonstrates the capacity of LLM agents to mimic competition and cooperation in human societies but also validates a promising vision of computational social science. Specifically, it suggests that LLM agents could be utilized to model human social interactions, including those with spontaneous collaborations, thus offering insights into social phenomena.
