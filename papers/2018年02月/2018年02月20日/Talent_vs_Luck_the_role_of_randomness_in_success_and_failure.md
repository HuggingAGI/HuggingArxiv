> Talent vs Luck: the role of randomness in success and failure

# 摘要

> 摘要：高度竞争的西方文化中占主导地位的精英主义范式主要基于这样一种信念，即成功主要（如果不是完全）归因于个人品质，如天赋、智力、技能、努力或冒险精神。有时，我们愿意承认一定程度的运气也可能在取得重大物质成功方面发挥作用。但事实上，人们往往低估了外部力量在个人成功故事中的重要性。众所周知，智力或天赋在人群中呈高斯分布，而作为成功的代表的财富分布通常遵循幂律（帕累托定律）。输入的具有典型规模的正态分布与输出的规模不变分布之间的这种差异表明，在幕后有一些隐藏的因素在起作用。在本文中，借助一个非常简单的基于代理的模型，我们认为这种因素就是随机性。特别是，我们表明，如果在生活中取得成功确实需要一定程度的天赋，那么几乎从来不是最有天赋的人达到成功的最高峰，而是被平庸但明显更幸运的人超越。据我们所知，这个违反直觉的结果——尽管在大量文献中隐晦地暗示——在这里首次被量化。它为根据所达到的成功水平评估功绩的有效性提供了新的视角，并强调了将过多的荣誉或资源分配给那些最终可能只是比其他人更幸运的人的风险。借助这个模型，还提出并比较了几个政策假设，以展示为提高精英管理、多样性和创新而进行公共研究资助的最有效策略。

Abstract:The largely dominant meritocratic paradigm of highly competitive Western cultures is rooted on the belief that success is due mainly, if not exclusively, to personal qualities such as talent, intelligence, skills, efforts or risk taking. Sometimes, we are willing to admit that a certain degree of luck could also play a role in achieving significant material success. But, as a matter of fact, it is rather common to underestimate the importance of external forces in individual successful stories. It is very well known that intelligence or talent exhibit a Gaussian distribution among the population, whereas the distribution of wealth - considered a proxy of success - follows typically a power law (Pareto law). Such a discrepancy between a Normal distribution of inputs, with a typical scale, and the scale invariant distribution of outputs, suggests that some hidden ingredient is at work behind the scenes. In this paper, with the help of a very simple agent-based model, we suggest that such an ingredient is just randomness. In particular, we show that, if it is true that some degree of talent is necessary to be successful in life, almost never the most talented people reach the highest peaks of success, being overtaken by mediocre but sensibly luckier individuals. As to our knowledge, this counterintuitive result - although implicitly suggested between the lines in a vast literature - is quantified here for the first time. It sheds new light on the effectiveness of assessing merit on the basis of the reached level of success and underlines the risks of distributing excessive honors or resources to people who, at the end of the day, could have been simply luckier than others. With the help of this model, several policy hypotheses are also addressed and compared to show the most efficient strategies for public funding of research in order to improve meritocracy, diversity and innovation.
